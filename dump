hardware display camera battery life software performance us carrier models wrap-up comments down close if sbn.openx.istablet else how do you review a phone like the galaxy s iii it s already been subject to so much speculation exposure and early judgment some of it coming from myself admittedly that it feels overwhelming to try and condense what it means to everyone into a single treatise to samsung it s the new flagship handset to keep the company ahead of every other android oem through 2012 for most people it s a device that stretches the definition of the smartphone form factor and to mobile gaming enthusiasts it s potentially the most powerful platform yet being a spec leader isn t new to samsung but the galaxy s iii betrays an even loftier ambition south korea s largest chaebol wants to also be known as a front runner in software android 4.0 is the basis upon which samsung has built a formidable list of new and returning enhancements s beam s memo s planner s voice smart stay direct call and even a limited-term exclusive of the flipboard android app throwing in 50gb of free dropbox storage for two years makes samsung s offering seem comprehensive but is it cohesive that ll be the primary question to answer for people wondering if the long wait for the galaxy s iii has been worth it video review video review hardware hardware designed for humans who don t mind fake brushed aluminum galaxy s iii review gallery previous next view full gallery previous next jdocument.readyfunction j gallery2806741 .gallery everything you do with the galaxy s iii starts and ends with its 4.8-inch super amoled screen so it s fitting that samsung has sought to minimize the amount of material surrounding it as big as the display is it doesn t make the phone feel terribly unwieldy you ll still find yourself adjusting your grip to reach the top corners but there s almost no degradation in usability relative to a 4.3-inch device like the galaxy s ii as is now almost standard across flagship handsets one piece of glass covers the entire front punctuated by the home button at the bottom and the earpiece at the top a silvery band wraps around the galaxy s iii s sides and its curvature is extended by the rear cover which is white on my review unit or a faux-brushed aluminum blue on the alternate version i ve never been a fan of plastic being made to look like metal it feels disingenuous both on the part of the company selling the product and subsequently the person owning it and i find it makes the galaxy s iii look cheap it s okay for samsung to use plastic to build this phone but less so to feign that it s made of higher-grade materials the white version suffers from this issue in a more diminished way than the darker variant its silver sides have been subjected to a similar treatment as the pebble blue gs iii aside from being somewhat aesthetically challenged the galaxy s iii feels like a very well built device it s thin light and shaped just right to make handling it a joy while i still prefer the sharper looks of the htc one x the galaxy s iii feels gentler and easier in the hand perhaps we can finally accuse a mobile phone manufacturer of subjugating form to the needs of function in spite of its size the galaxy s iii has better ergonomics than many smaller phonesalthough the back cover is made of a glossy and seemingly flimsy plastic samsung s previous android handsets with similar plastic shells have tended to be very durable the galaxy s and nexus s would pick up scratches easily but you could drop them almost on a daily basis without fear of something cracking or buckling samsung also deserves credit for flattening out the rear of this phone there are no more humps at the bottom as with the previous galaxy s iterations plus there s no protrusion around the camera as you ll find on the htc one x physical measurements for the galaxy s iii are almost identical to htc s one x its most direct competitor and in practice you really cannot tell a difference between the two when you factor in that samsung s phone fits a significantly larger battery 2100mah versus the one x s 1800mah and actually lets you swap it out thanks to the removable cover you have to hand the functional design advantage to the galaxy s iii its microsd card slot also makes it more versatile in terms of storage however you can t hot-swap micro sim cards on the galaxy s iii the way you can on the one x still my general impression of samsung s new flagship is that the closer your scrutinize this phone the more impressive it becomes the ergonomic advantages of the galaxy s iii also extend to the few buttons it has i ve grown to prefer samsung s choice of mounting the power button on the side which is particularly handy with taller devices such as this it s also good to have a physical home button at the center giving you a tactile reference point much in the same way as the little nubs on the f and j keys on desktop keyboards serve to orient your fingers it s the little things that count and speaking of little things i love that samsung has borrowed the disguised status led light from the galaxy nexus placing it in the top left corner of the galaxy s iii display display serving as the primary means for both input and output makes the display the most critical aspect of a mobile device s hardware everything else can be perfect but if you can t stand looking at the screen you will not enjoy using your phone samsung s long been a leader in this area with its super amoled displays particularly the latest generation of super amoled plus panels regrettably the galaxy s iii is a step behind the cutting edge of samsung s research most likely because a s-amoled plus display of this size and resolution is not yet feasible leaving it with a 4.8-inch 1280 x 720 pentile amoled display is it pentile yes is that a problem no as keen as i am to consign the rgbg pentile subpixel arrangement to the annals of history the fact is that samsung s use of it in the galaxy s iii is not something that negatively impacts the user experience if you try hard you will be able to spot evidence of the pentile matrix affecting the smoothness of fine edges but that s only of academic importance this 4.8-inch display can be held up proudly alongside most other amoled panels sadly while that may have been a great compliment a year or two ago the quality and viewing angles of amoled have recently been bypassed by refinements in lcd technology htc s one x is the standout demonstration of that offering unrivalled clarity color balance and viewing angles in all of those respects the galaxy s iii is one or two tiers below the one x its display has the usual blue tinge characteristic of amoled displays which gets worse as you begin to look at it off-center relying on the gs iii s automatic brightness is also problematic as the phone tends to lean toward under-illuminating itself making it usually a little too dark for comfortable use exactly as with the galaxy s ii the auto-brightness jumps around in discrete stages making for abrupt changes in brightness instead of a more gradual transition touch responsiveness from the galaxy s iii s screen and the two capacitive buttons underneath it framing the physical home key is perfectly reliable and gives no cause for complaint on the whole i d say this is a display that will serve the vast majority of people extremely well provided they re never unfortunate enough to see it side by side with a one x super amoled isn t as exceptional as it once was but it s still good camera camera everyone promises a better camera samsung actually delivers the galaxy s ii set a high bar for smartphone camera performance but the galaxy s iii has beaten it image quality on this phone is simply excellent full-resolution pictures look sharp and detailed allowing you to crop in on areas of interest unlike the htc one x which can furnish you with some neat results but never at the full 8-megapixel resolution the fact the galaxy s iii can achieve that feat means it has a higher usable resolution than the one x and pretty much any other smartphone on the market laudable though the camera may be it is not without its shortcomings the primary one you ll notice from the gallery of sample images is a limited dynamic range the galaxy s iii exposes images in accordance with what it thinks you re trying to shoot it usually guesses correctly though i d have preferred the tap-to-focus function to also force the camera to expose specifically for the spot i m focusing on which can result in overly dark or bright areas in images with a wide range of brightness you ll see a lot of pure-white skies in the picture set shot on a sunny day in london which the aforementioned lack of tap-to-expose functionality makes it difficult to correct in recognition of this relatively common weakness to its sensor samsung has also added an hdr mode to the galaxy s iii taking multiple shots at different exposures and combining them into a composite image that option works well salvaging detail from areas that would otherwise be over- or under-exposed however the resulting images can never look as natural as ones taken in the regular fashion galaxy s iii camera sample images previous next view full gallery previous next jdocument.readyfunction j gallery2806753 .gallery the galaxy s iii s camera software is in keeping with what you ll be familiar with from the galaxy s ii customizable shortcuts sit on the left side of the display when held in landscape while the capture key and a video / stills toggle reside on the right in spite of also having hdr and a new burst mode it s not as refined or intuitive an experience as you d get from htc s imagesense which still remains the standard bearer for camera software irrespective of os samsung has included a face detection feature in its gallery app however its performance is hilariously inconsistent in two practically identical self-portraits it recognized my face correctly once and ignored it the second time was that too much to handle in another photo the phone identified a person s face accurately but also put a potential face tag on an area of fencing a very small but appreciated addition from samsung is a direct link to delete an image while looking at one in portrait mode for some reason that shortcut has been missing from the stock android 4.0 interface and its absence has annoyed me until now the 1.9-megapixel front-facing camera supports the rear-facing shooter admirably producing better than average image quality for its class that doesn t mean the pictures you get from it will be good just passable but more so than what you usually get from these afterthought cameras there s one major flaw to image recording with the galaxy s iii and that s autofocus during video it jumps back and forth in an irritating fashion even when there s not much in the way of challenging motion in the frame that really precludes the gs iii from being used for semi-professional or otherwise important video if you can t rely on the camera to keep a steady focus how can you be certain of the eventual output this is a terrible shame since the high level of detail obtained in stills shot with the galaxy s iii is also present in its video recordings battery life battery life reception and audio the famously large 2100mah battery within the galaxy s iii has few competitors on the market only the galaxy note at 2500mah and the droid razr maxx at 3300mah can claim to contain larger cells inside smartphone-like enclosures that gets the gs iii off to a good start though you shouldn t expect it to actually be too far ahead of the competition its vast 4.8-inch display and superpowered quad-core processor do make full use of the energy available under intensive use the galaxy s iii lasted a solid seven hours before flashing up a low battery alert that time included capturing 137 gps-tagged photos and six 1080p video clips at an average length of 40 seconds running multiple instances of our favorite benchmarks and the usual poking and prodding that comes with investigating a new device the following day i was able to go from 8am to 11pm before facing a critical battery warning while again giving the phone regular use and syncing up gmail twitter and flipboard predictably battery drain was at its fastest when the self-illuminating amoled display was turned on with a period of nearly three hours around lunchtime knocking only a few percentage points off my energy reserves with judicious use you could probably go a full 24 hours between recharging this phone not terribly impressive to someone coming from a featurephone but very reasonable given the size of the display and the amount of power the galaxy s iii offers another note of import with regard to the gs iii s battery is that it houses the phone s nfc chip that s a repeat of the way samsung did things with the galaxy nexus and shouldn t pose a problem to most people but if you have your heart on set on buying multiple batteries for this handset and using it as a true road warrior s sidekick it ll be something to keep in mind audio output is handled by a single loudspeaker on the rear which can be muffled easily by pressing a finger against it but doesn t seem to suffer too much when the galaxy s iii is laid on its back in any case much like the front-facing camera it s just passable in quality and will be used only in emergencies raising the volume up doesn t lead to much distortion and you ll have no trouble using it as a speakerphone the bundled pair of in-ear headphones are of reasonable quality they don t have a particularly wide sound stage and don t isolate external noise as well as you might expect but they have strong slightly exaggerated bass response and are adequate substitutes for your higher-quality listening gear i ve not yet been able to confirm this with samsung but early reports suggest the gs iii has a wolfson dac residing within it like the nexus s before it which is a sign that the sound quality you ll obtain from this phone will not disappoint i listened to a deadmau5 album on the gs iii with a set of shure se315 in-ear headphones plugged in and i was not disappointed voice calls on the galaxy s iii were a revelationif you care to tweak your music a little further samsung s music player app includes a vast range of eq presets you can pick the one that s most to your liking or leave it automated and let the phone do the thinking for you there s a music player widget for the home screen and playback controls automatically appear in the notifications menu but there are no music controls on the lock screen additionally using the volume rocker now brings up the option to directly alter the full set of volume levels giving you more direct access to that menu voice calls on the galaxy s iii were a revelation call clarity was noticeably superior to any phones i ve used recently conveying natural sound in both directions reception was also reliably strong and data speeds are indistinguishable from those obtained with the well-performing htc one x samsung strikes a fine balance between power-hungry parts and battery size software software the wiz strikes back touchwiz android 4.0 may underpin every interaction you have with the galaxy s iii but samsung has diligently skinned almost everything about the operating system the only break from the norm is that i don t actually mind that fact touchwiz particularly in this latest iteration is the only android oem skin that i feel i can live with over the long term as excellent a device as the htc one x is sense 4 pretty much forces you to install apex launcher in order to restore some of android s sanity and visual consistency this nature ux-branded version of touchwiz doesn t invite such feelings of dread i wouldn t describe it as pretty nor particularly efficient the space saved by moving the soft android keys into the bottom bezel has been taken up by vast spaces between icons on the home screen but plenty of its changes are actually for the better samsung has clung on to the android menu button which turns out to be a good thingthe primary advantage here is a somewhat counterintuitive one samsung has broken with google s ice cream sandwich not only in replacing the soft android keys with its tried and trusted combination of capacitive and physical buttons but also in its choice of functions instead of a dedicated multitasking key the galaxy s iii retains a context-dependent menu button multitasking has been relegated to a long press of the home button in regular use i found this to be the most sensible way to arrange those keys better than even google s own solution moving the multitasking thumbnails from left to right is also helpful to right-handed users who can now reach them more easily other improvements over stock android 4.0 include a set of quick toggles in the slide-down notifications tray plus the aforementioned trash icon shortcut in the gallery app and quick access to granular volume control the app launcher is refreshingly sparse carrying no aesthetic baggage and giving you total control you can hide unwanted apps rearrange the grid to your liking or switch to a list view it does help that entering and exiting that menu is done with scintillating fluidity thanks to the excellent processor inside the galaxy s iii that power is also harnessed on the lock screen where the default unlocking animation is a water ripple pretty much the only evidence i could find of samsung s supposed nature ux that really is a soulless branding exercise some old touchwiz favorites are still here such as swiping a contact s name one way to call and another way to message you can do that on the contacts list or from within the messaging app it s not entirely consistent with google s effort in android 4.0 to make lateral swipes the central method for dismissing items as witnessed in the multitasking overview and notifications tray both present on the galaxy s iii but i find those shortcuts useful to have anyway getting to grips with them just might not be as quick and intuitive as a thoroughly coherent ui on the topic of intuitiveness i m sure there s a way to alter the four quick-launch icons present on the lock screen but after two full days with the galaxy s iii i ve still not managed to dig deep enough into the configuration menus to figure out how that s done that s not helped by samsung customizing the entire settings menu galaxy s iii nature ux screenshots previous next view full gallery previous next jdocument.readyfunction j gallery2806746 .gallery underneath all the samsung spit-polish you ll still find the core strengths of android s latest version including the updated gmail client compatibility with chrome for android detailed data and battery usage charts and simply all-around better performance the calendar app has been eschewed in favor of samsung s own s planner which i consider a move in the wrong direction two other aspects of the user experience are troublesome firstly there are still bugs in the ui that have not been ironed out when waking the phone you re sometimes greeted by a quick glimpse of the last home screen you were on before the lock screen appears and at other times you have to wait for a weirdly long time for anything to show up that detracts from the otherwise very quick navigation on offer from the galaxy s iii the second pain point is that you can t create folders by dragging icons atop one another you have to pick up an app from the app launcher drag it to a dedicated create folder link and only then place that folder on your home screen don t ask me why that is the way it is added functionality although the lock screen is bereft of any music playback controls it can be used to pause anything you re listening to just by placing the palm of your hand over the display the same action works when playing back video as well while a lateral swipe of your palm across the screen will take a screenshot both are part of samsung s deluge of motion controls though they re arguably the only ones that will get any consistent use after the initial surge of curiosity one truly unique feature to the galaxy s iii is the introduction of a picture-in-picture samsung calls it pop up play option it s available with any video you have on the phone allowing you to keep watching it in a small repositionable window atop the usual phone interface i still haven t made up my mind whether i consider this a gimmick or not though there s no denying that it s highly impressive in technical terms treading the fine line between feature and gimmicks beam is samsung s enhancement of the standard android beam in ics with android beam you can transfer small packets of information nfc-capable devices but with s beam you can use the nfc connection to initiate a wi-fi direct linkup between the galaxy s iii and another compatible device to transfer far bigger files there are two problems with this firstly i ve yet to see android beam work reliably and my attempts to send an image and a maps location over from the gs iii to the htc one x were met with resolute failure i was only able to successfully transfer a contact card between the two phones the second issue is simply one of scarcity the only phone you can have s beam relations with at the moment is another galaxy s iii hence equipped with only one review device i haven t been able to test out the reliability of that function more tweaks from samsung include the ability to direct call a contact you re composing a text message to by just lifting the phone to your ear and a smart alert that will vibrate the phone when you pick it up after an extended period of idleness to inform you of missed calls or unread messages the former has a spectacularly narrow set of legitimate use scenarios but works for what that s worth and the latter misleads more often than it helps making me think i only just received a new message or email the branding is confusing but the functions themselves are pretty straightforwardsmart stay is yet another software feature to be granted its own marketing name it doesn t do anything revolutionary the front-facing camera tracks your eyes and if it identifies that you re still looking at the handset when not interacting with it it won t switch the display off at the usual screen timeout time put the phone down on a desk so that it can t see your eyes directly or try using it in the dark and smart stay becomes decidedly dumb i m not begrudging the inclusion of this feature it s reliable most of the time and has its uses but samsung didn t need to overstate its intelligence the way it did during that dizzying press event earlier this month the additions of flipboard and the bonus dropbox storage are the only major concessions to third-party software providers serving to augment samsung s in-house solutions there was a rumor of a samsung s cloud only storage service ahead of the galaxy s iii launch however that hasn t materialized at least not yet s voice say hello to siri for android as produced by samsung if you harbored any doubt as to whether or not samsung ripped off apple s voice assistant let it go now that s not to suggest that apple invented voice commands on mobile phones samsung had the vlingo-powered voice talk on the galaxy s ii but the look and feel of this application takes so much inspiration from apple s effort on the iphone 4s as to deserve being labelled a clone not that any of this matters a great deal neither siri nor s voice is good enough in its present incarnation if you have to repeat or correct yourself you might as well use more conventional means to achieve your goals voice consistently chews up my words when i try asking it questions although it works better when instructed to schedule an appointment or set an alarm it can also be used as an unlocking mechanism once you pre-record a pass phrase that adds to the face unlocking option that s native to android 4.0 in being frustratingly unwieldy and planted firmly within gimmick territory more than once i was stuck repeating hello without any recognition from the phone the state of these voice control apps reminds of the hulk movie starring eric bana and the matrix reloaded both were released in 2003 during a time when the enthusiasm for integrating computer-generated graphics into action scenes was that little bit too far ahead of the best technology available though both films represented the state of the art in their time they have aged terribly since then and shown the folly of using technology for a purpose it s not fully ready to fulfill that s what both s voice and siri are to me exhibitions of technology that can potentially become central to how you use your phone but presently too constrained and unpolished to truly perform that role in short just because voice control on your phone now has a brand name attached to it doesn t mean that it s actually worth using kies air if you want to sync up the galaxy s iii with your mac via a wired connection you ll need the android file transfer app windows is rather easier though on the mac i had a problem getting the aft application to recognize this handset and fell back to an old favorite by downloading kies air from the play store this app doesn t ship on the galaxy s iii replaced by something called kies via wi-fi that doesn t work nearly as well but samsung gets the credit for creating it nonetheless kies air requires that your computer and samsung smartphone are connected to the same wi-fi network then gives you a url to punch into your desktop browser and asks you authorize yourself once you ve tried accessing the phone s storage in that way once in there you ve got a litany of options including downloading and uploading files checking and updating your calendar and making changes to your contacts messages bookmarks and ringtones for extra security you can lock some of these categories on the phone so that they re not accessible from the remote computer the best method for wirelessly syncing your phone with a computer bar nonei managed to pull a song out of my music collection and turn it into my phone s ringtone within seconds i also used this method to download all the sample photography shot with the galaxy s iii which happened in the background while i continued using the device is there a better way to wirelessly sync a smartphone not to my knowledge performance performance there s one word for this device beastly i ve been alluding to this throughout the review but the galaxy s iii is a processing powerhouse as amazing as the snapdragon s4 and tegra 3 have proven for performance samsung s new exynos chip bests them both the usual benchmarking provisos apply here what this data represents is only a snapshot one that i ve verified through first-hand use of the processing capabilities of the galaxy s iii scores in antutu and quadrant are both constrained by the galaxy s iii s 60fps cap meaning neither is fully accounting for its gpu power glbenchmark does a better job of that since it renders the requisite frames off-screen and thus bypasses the limitation that

applications to push the gs iii to its full potential at the present moment the only real difference between the dual-core snapdragon s4 and samsung s new quad-core exynos is that the former has shown itself to be more power-efficient both will handle any android game you throw at them and there are no guarantees that the the gs iii s extra power will result in a tangible real world advantage before it comes time for you to upgrade your phone again if samsung does indeed opt for qualcomm s chips in its upcoming us version of this phone it shouldn t be too much of a loss us carrier models us carrier models no matter where you buy it you re still buying a galaxy s iii the galaxy s iii is only the second phone we ve seen released worldwide as a single model with a single name the iphone s the only other device to pull off such a feat the handset is coming to all four major us carriers verizon at amp t sprint and t-mobile plus a few regionals like us cellular and c spire all the us variants swap the potent exynos processor for a snapdragon s4 as mentioned above its benchmark results are slightly below the exynos but the s4 isn t far behind it s an extremely powerful soc and if anything is slightly more power-efficient than samsung s chipset the at amp t model connects to the carrier s lte network which has lost a bit of its sheen since our tests with the lg nitro hd resulted in 60mbps download speed it s still fast though i saw speeds as high as 9.5mbps down and 16mbps up on the network at amp t also adds a couple of bloatware apps to the mix but in general the device is every bit the galaxy s iii same goes for the sprint variant which like at amp t s model adds a couple of bloatware apps and a new network without changing much of anything else sprint s lte network is slowly rolling out but it s not available yet and until it does performance is fairly anemic speeds peaked at a paltry 224kbps down and 529kbps up verizon customers get a surprise similar experience though verizon has added a few additional software tweaks that are considerably more irritating it has the same omnipresent wi-fi status bar as the droid incredible 4g lte plus a somewhat larger portion of bloatware still access to verizon s nationwide lte network is a huge plus we saw download speeds as high as 30mbps but more commonly hovering at about 7mbps and upload speeds were typically 3-8mbps battery life on all three models was about the same you ll get a full day of use from the device but no more sprint s model lasted a bit longer since it doesn t have the battery-crushing lte connectivity but of course there s also a huge speed upside to the lte model it s a testament to samsung s power and vision that it managed to release virtually identical devices across the us and every carrier is better for it if you buy the galaxy s iii for t-mobile you ll land somewhere in the middle speeds were far better than on sprint s plodding network but not quite up to at amp t s lte standards we saw speeds averaging about 9.5mbps down and 1.3mbps up battery life outstripped both other variants though lasting a day and a half unless you really stress the

stuff stellar performance even without an exynos soc excellent camera functionally sound design android tweaks have mostly been for the better bad stuff aesthetically challenged touchwiz takes getting used to s voice is no less of a gimmick than siri samsung has a history of failing to update phones on time a lot of good mixed in with a little bit of bad one thing that goes consistently overlooked with respect to samsung s phones is the company s ignominious track record with android software updates there may be worse offenders out there but samsung s chronic failure to update its devices on time or at all is a significant black mark for a brand looking to lead the way in almost every other respect thus as much as i may enjoy the galaxy s iii today i have to temper that enthusiasm with the knowledge that its long-term future may not be as rosy as that of a stock android device or one produced by htc that having been said the galaxy s iii is a technological triumph not at first sight perhaps but samsung has done the overwhelming majority of things right the camera is easily the best i ve used on an android device the processor claims the title of benchmarking champion and the customizations layered on top of ice cream sandwich are mostly unobtrusive and sometimes even helpful they never really gel into one coherent user experience meaning you ll have to learn what each new feature does individually rather than intuiting it from the phone s general behavior however that s a trifling complaint when compared to our usual disappointments with android oem skins touchwiz may still have its illogicalities but it s been cleaned up and streamlined sufficiently to make it an adequate alternative to google s stock experience while neither the display nor the construction materials on the galaxy s iii are the best possible both represent acceptable compromises that help samsung balance out the rest of its class-leading spec sheet verizon s variant of the galaxy s iii comes with a bit of a compromise you get access to verizon s large and fast lte network yes but you also have to put up with more and more intrusive interference from the carrier like irritating wi-fi nagging and extra bloatware apps still as with all the us variants it s a remarkably powerful phone even with a snapdragon s4 instead of the exynos soc and is still close to samsung s vision for its flagship phone verizon s competition is somewhat less impressive than some other carriers with only the weakest of htc s one series standing in its way there are plenty of good android phones on verizon but the galaxy s iii might be the best one yet the extra-large size of this phone even with its great ergonomics may prove to be a stumbling block for those who can t comfortably fit a

pricing starting its u.s sales debut with five carriers -- verizon at amp t sprint t-mobile and u.s cellular -- makes this smartphone nearly ubiquitous samsung s aggressive distribution strategy gives it a leg up against its chief android rival the htc one x but it fails to sweep htc s finest and apple fans will scoff at samsung s imitation siri that isn t to say that the galaxy s iii henceforth also known as the gs3 does not impress from the outside in it has a large vibrant hd display android 4.0 ice cream sandwich a sharp 8-megapixel camera 4g lte or hspa support a zippy dual-core

samsung for formulaic specs and design and to some extent the critics are correct samsung isn t setting hardware standards with new creations and the gs3 s software additions while interesting and useful mostly build off existing android capabilities regardless samsung has continued to produce stronger subsequent models than its first galaxy s home run there s a reason why the galaxy s ii sold over 50 million units worldwide and why the gs3 s preorder sales smashed u.k records samsung clearly has its formula worked out for making higher-end features familiar expected and easily within reach

available in 16gb blue white and 32gb blue white models this is a review of the 16gb version of t-mobile s gs3 in pebble blue design it won t wow you with neon colors or evocative industrial design it doesn t have the sharpest screen on the market and its body isn t fashioned from ceramic glass or micro-arc oxidized aluminum that said the galaxy s3 is about the nicest plastic phone i ve ever seen likely tired of hearing complaints about how cheap-feeling samsung phones can be the company decided to focus instead on making the contours more premium -- without giving up its light inexpensive and shatterproof material of choice the samsung galaxy s iii looks and feels smooth glossy and far more luxe than previous galaxy handsets credit josh miller/cnet peer closely at the phone it comes in ceramic white pebble blue and later a red shade exclusive to at amp t and you ll see that samsung has rounded the edges and corners to attain smooth spines and trim pieces all around the phone designers also intentionally arranged the backing to give the phone more of a unibody feel samsung doesn t shy away from high gloss and sheen in either white or blue models and somehow it all works the pebble-blue variety has lighter blue spines than its steel gray-blue backing and i like the brushed-metal grain to its uncompromisingly plastic finish in addition the phone has felt good in my hand every time i ve picked it up since ctia it s slick and touchable and seems to warm to the touch which gives it the sense that it s conforming to your grip though smooth the gs3 isn t slippery and although fairly light at 4.7 ounces just a tad heavier than the one x it doesn t feel like it s missing a battery or other essential components the handset s highly reflective surfaces are its most major design flaw when it comes to size the gs3 is a big device at 5.4 inches tall and 2.8 inches wide it s slightly larger and thicker than the samsung galaxy nexus samsung seems to enjoy pushing the envelope when it comes to creating smartphone displays that border on minitablet territory the 5.3-inch galaxy note even became a cult hit with about 7 million global sales yet the handset s slim 0.34-inch width contoured sides and glossy coating add up to that comfortable handhold my hands are fairly small so i passed the phone around to see what others thought regardless of their personal phone choice most initially found the gs3 large but warmed up to it as they played around those with smaller hands than mine generally thought it too big almost all of them commented on the light weight my colleagues also stuck the gs3 in front back shirt and jacket pockets everyone found a way they said they d carry it which really only proves that cnet editors are a resourceful bunch press and hold the gs3 s home button to surface your recent apps double-press to launch s voice credit josh miller/cnet above the screen are the proximity and ambient light sensors the indicator led and a 1.9-megapixel front-facing camera below it is a physical home button which samsung managed to keep in this handset as opposed to the typical soft-touch navigation buttons we often see in android phones in general i can get behind this kind of button but the gs3 s is slightly less comfy in its squashed and narrow form than if it were a larger rectangle or a square flanking this button are the back key and the menu key which fade after a few seconds of use it s interesting that samsung kept its menu button rather than the default recent-apps tab in ice cream sandwich you can still view recent applications by holding down the home button on the right spine is the power button and on the left you ll find the volume rocker you ll charge through a micro-usb power button on the bottom and listen to audio through the 3.5mm headset jack up top the 8-megapixel camera lens and flash are on the rear with the microsd card slot and near-field communication nfc-capable battery behind the back cover the galaxy s iii takes a micro-sim card all about the screen in terms of screen size the galaxy s iii s 4.8-inch hd super amoled display with a 1 280x720-pixel resolution fits right between the galaxy nexus 4.65 inches and the galaxy note 5.3 inches both of them honkers on their own it s almost identical to the htc one x 4.7 inches how much you like the size depends on your preference for large-screen phones if you like em on the smaller side you ll find this excessive if you enjoy having more screen real estate for reading and watching videos you ll likely approve the hd super amoled screen on the galaxy s3 center was dimmer beside other top smartphones the htc one x top and iphone 4s bottom credit josh miller/cnet samsung s new flagship phone is one of the first handsets to use corning s gorilla glass 2 a thinner lighter more responsive cover glass material that the two companies also say lets colors shine brighter i definitely noticed the screen s sensitivity at times i barely had to brush the display for a response colors looked bright and vibrant with the phone in a dark setting but slide to full brightness and the screen sometimes seemed dark especially when compared with other phones at full throttle like typical amoled displays the gs3 overdoes it on the greens which stand out more than on phones with lcd screens or when you view photos you took yourself i downloaded a high-res image with varying contrasts and colors on five phones also at peak brightness -- the gs3 galaxy nexus galaxy note iphone 4s and htc one x the galaxy note s resolution was a little looser than that of the other four because of its lower pixel density the gs3 showed a much dimmer picture than the galaxy nexus did colors on the htc one x and iphone 4s were bright and looked truer to life blacks looked blacker on the nexus amoled screen but there was far more detail throughout the images on the one x and iphone 4s which both use lcd screens with in-plane switching ips from there quality was a tossup with some features of the image looking better on the iphone and some looking better on the one x samsung s galaxy s iii unboxing at always on don t get me wrong -- the gs3 s screen is still lovely when you aren t peering at it side by side with another screen but the comparative image darkness is a little disappointing and was especially noticeable in my sunny-day photo and video shoots part of the screen dimness problem is that some apps like the browser were actually less bright by default even when i changed system settings to full blast the browser remained dimmer until i changed its individual brightness setting in general i appreciate samsung s power-saving checks and balances but checking settings throughout the phone was confusing interface and os android 4.0 ice cream sandwich looks great on the gs3 especially because samsung used a lighter hand with its touchwiz interface than on previous versions that said samsung hasn t fully adopted all of google s visual cues like the ics menu i personally miss this interface touch with touchwiz samsung is able to add things like gestures and systems control access in the notifications pull-down there are also the unique additions that samsung tacked on to android beam android beam gets a boost in s beam which can share videos and photos with a tap credit josh miller/cnet not every one of the gs3 s special additions is essential and some like sharing content through allshare play and groupcast are unnecessarily complicated to set up and use while samsung deserves kudos for brainstorming and implementing these features customers will care more about overall camera performance than the capability to tag friends faces in photos s beam built on top of android beam for ice cream sandwich the samsung-only s beam wields nfc and wi-fi direct to beam larger-file photos videos and documents -- that s in addition to android beam s capability of sharing urls maps and contact information behind the scenes nfc initiates the handshake and the wi-fi direct protocol takes over for larger files the combination isn t groundbreaking perhaps but samsung deserves credit for packing it up in one seamless action as with beam you won t have to do more than press the backs of the phones together confirm the beam and pull the phones apart the larger the file the longer it usually takes for the transfer magic to happen s beam worked flawlessly every time i tried it samsung really does get a high-five for this addition which goes beyond simple cleverness to actual usefulness s voice and then there s s voice samsung s answer to apple s siri s voice is a personal assistant that plumps up android s built-in voice actions into the more personal format that apple popularized with siri vlingo powers s voice on the listening and interpretation front siri uses nuance and sources answers from databases like wolfram alpha you launch s voice by double-pressing the home button and can wake up s voice in between commands by saying hello galaxy this is optional and drains the battery faster you can do a lot with s voice left but only if it understands you right credit jessica dolcourt/cnet s voice can launch apps and turn-by-turn navigation switch into driving mode voice-dial tweet get the weather compose a memo search contacts and schedule tasks it can also take a photo place and answer calls search the web adjust the volume send e-mail and text messages record voices and launch the native music player it also ties into android 4.0 s lock screen security so you can use your voice to unlock the phone as a bonus you can program four of your own voice commands to open the camera record your voice and check for missed calls and messages s voice sounds great in theory but it didn t work well sometimes it didn t work at all throughout my testing period i used s voice extensively asking the phone to perform the full range of tasks sometimes it delivered what i wanted immediately like driving directions or turning wi-fi on and off other times it must have stuffed cotton in its digital ears and repeatedly garbled or blanked on what i wanted my favorite was when it knew exactly what i said repeated my command you can choose voice feedback in addition to text and then did nothing there was also the time that s voice stalled on deleting an alarm then ignored my subsequent request to finish the first one s voice is samsung s garbled answer to apple s siri credit josh miller/cnet on the whole s voice is more rigid than siri about syntax and the software takes a while to process unless i m driving or otherwise hands-free i find it faster and less frustrating to set your own alarm or turn on driving directions before engaging the ignition siri also has its share of slowness and interpretation issues but it s performed more consistently for me in my tests thus far stay tuned for a more detailed comparison with siri and in the meantime check out our cnet uk editor s test in which s voice clearly won only one out of 15 voice test scenarios a poor showing that makes s voice seem more like a beta product than a siri substitute i ll update this review with a similar showdown sharing software multimedia sharing is a galaxy s3 emphasis with four main ways to share your stuff through different means like dlna and wi-fi direct protocols allshare play uses dlna to share multimedia across your samsung tvs tablets and phones so you can play a video you shot on your phone on the tv and do things like control the volume from your handset a web storage element has you access content on your other devices by tapping into a third-party client sugarsync face recognition software prompts you to tag yourself and your friends even on photos taken with the front-facing camera like this one credit josh miller/cnet groupcast which you can use as a presentation service uses allshare play it takes seven steps including a password and pin number to set up the share but once you do you can share a folder -- like slides or photos -- across all phones you ve invited into the groupcast any device can control the screens and annotate with pen strokes that fade after a few seconds samsung should let the groupcast leader lock it down buddy photo share is a neat optional in-camera feature that can e-mail or text a freshly shot photo to the person you tag in it photos show up in a received folder in the recipient s gallery shareshot is a camera shooting mode that uses wi-fi direct in the background to automatically send photos to your friends as you shoot them instead of e-mailing them after the fact multiple people can get in on the deal -- so long as they re within about 100 yards about the length of a football field photos also appear in the gallery you lose shareshot when you switch shooting modes my problem with these tools is that some of them have unintuitive and disjointed user experiences it isn t always obvious how to get to a feature how to sign others up and how to find your shared content afterward samsung galaxy s3 torture test at always on features an android ice cream sandwich phone through and through the gs3 is fully loaded with all the google goodies and then some there are the google apps and services like gmail maps with turn-by-turn voice navigation a music player and youtube to name just a few wi-fi gps wi-fi direct and bluetooth 4.0 are other communication features along with nfc which powers stuff you can do with tectiles and google

smartphones and brings it up to current high-end standards its bright sharp amoled display is one of the largest on any smartphone at 4.8 inches it boasts one of the best cameras we ve seen on a phone short of nokia s 41-megapixel pureview 808 that is it has great voice quality and it can effortlessly handle the most demanding apps it s also lighter than its predecessors weighing in at about 4.7 ounces compared to the galaxy nexus s 5.3 show morewhile samsung has stuffed it with social sharing and voice-control apps the real value of the s iii is as a solid well-designed high-end smartphone which works well with the high-speed 4g networks being deployed by us carriers that said we still prefer the at amp t-only htc one x which has similar specs but superior build quality and a better user interface for customers of all other carriers the s iii is the clear choice -- though the older galaxy nexus a former gdgt must have is no slouch and is still worth considering if you can get it

droid razr maxx making this no phone for people with small hands it s much lighter than the maxx though and gives you a considerably bigger screen in the same form factor 4.8 inches as opposed to 4.3 view all 4 photos in gallery i m not a fan of huge phones but i ve given up on panning them because every time i suggest these handsets are too big i get pummeled by comments from readers who adore them huge phones are the thing i accept it the all-plastic body feels a little flimsier than the rock-solid razrs but the phone is well built and light despite its size the front of the phone is dominated by the 4.8-inch 1280-by-720-pixel super amoled hd screen yes it s pentile which can sometimes look slightly pixelated and it s definitely dimmer than other top-of-the-line smartphones but killing the auto-brightness setting helps alleviate the dimness and the razr maxx is pentile too below the screen there s a physical home button as well as light-up back and multitasking buttons that start out invisible so you have to memorize where they are or change a setting to keep them illuminated the 8-megapixel camera is on the back panel which thanks to its reflective finish on the blue model doubles as a pocket mirror unlike the competing razr maxx the galaxy s iii has a removable 2100mah battery taking off the back cover also reveals the microsd card slot which supports cards up to

3g cdma and 4g lte networks now and it ll be able to hit global gsm/hspa networks with a software update coming soon verizon says signal strength was good on par with the droid razr maxx although the maxx sometimes reported a slightly stronger signal i didn t see any difference in terms of placing calls lte speeds as tested with sensorly and ookla software came out pretty consistently faster than the maxx a reflection of the gs3 s faster processor and a solid radio chip i m very happy to report that i didn t see any of the reception or call-quality problems here that plagued samsung s last major verizon phone the galaxy nexus 199 4 stars while the galaxy nexus rated well and has the latest version of android 4.1 jelly bean i tend not to recommend it enthusiastically because of its now-well-known connection problems call quality is fine although transmissions through the mic could be a bit clearer there s a lot of good news about the earpiece it s loud and you can tweak the sound quality through a custom eq scheme to make it sound even better to you the speakerphone is of medium volume fine in the car not quite loud enough on the street transmissions through the mic sounded a bit computerized on the other end and the speakerphone let through more background noise than i would have liked bluetooth headsets work fine with samsung s s-voice voice dialing system the galaxy s iii supports wi-fi on both the 2.4ghz and 5ghz bands bluetooth 4.0 and nfc are also onboard although google wallet is blocked on this phone the gps chip locked in extremely quickly and accurately in midtown manhattan battery life was excellent at 10 hours 43 minutes of talk time that isn t as long as the razr maxx s crazy 16 hours 45 minutes but it s very good nonetheless software and performancethe galaxy s iii runs android 4.0 ice cream sandwich with a whole lot of exclusive samsung extensions performance was excellent in my tests the qualcomm s4 chip running at 1.5ghz is the fastest one we ve seen in smartphones so far and it s able to take on any app challenge you throw at it including games on the hd screen as can be expected it scored slightly faster on our benchmarks than the razr maxx with its 1.2ghz ti chip the difference wasn t huge though both of these are very fast phones verizon bloatware is here like on other verizon phones the carrier s app store is the worst kind of bloat useless sluggish and empty there s also an app to launch the phone s wi-fi hotspot mode an account management app visual voicemail a vpn client the incomprehensible color social sharing app and verizon s own vz navigator gps app which now has 3d city views most of these apps can t be deleted beyond that there s the 400 000-plus apps in the google play store exclusive new samsung features include s-beam the ability to transfer files by tapping two phones together and using a combination of nfc and wi-fi direct s-voice samsung s answer to apple s siri tectiles nfc-enabled accessory tags that can change the settings on your phone and lots of sharing and tagging options in the camera such as the ability to automatically tag your friends faces and the ability for multiple gs3s within a few feet of each other to automatically share all of their photos many of these features work well but they re almost all buried the interface is something of a scavenger hunt take smart stay a neat new feature which detects your face and keeps the screen from going black while you re looking at it i love it but it s not on by default and the only way to turn it on is by going to the display area under settings s-beam is similarly buried under the wireless menu back to top 1 2 '),(268,'2012-06-20 00:00:00',7.0,46,' samsung s galaxy s iii smartphone will be available on five major u.s carriers starting june 21 photo by peter mccollough/wired samsung rightfully enjoys pointing out that it ships more android smartphones than anyone else and with its new galaxy s iii the south korean electronics giant has accomplished something only apple has been able to do so far sell the same exact phone at the same price across major u.s carriers without letting them slap their logos on the front of the device this is truly an achievement and a win for consumers who can just shop for the hardware they want instead of merely settling for the best hardware available on their carrier it s a coup i wish htc would have been able to make happen with its stellar one x handset but samsung beat htc in that race and starting this month the galaxy s iii will roll out to at amp t sprint t-mobile verizon and u.s cellular for 200 with 16gb of storage the same price as the iphone and the one x while it s a fine smartphone it s not the unqualified success it aspires to be and it s regrettably held back by software that never works as well or as easily as it should the galaxy s iii is samsung s most ambitious smartphone yet and it serves as a testament to the company s growing stature as a premium handset maker however the s iii isn t quite an iphone killer nor does it dethrone the one x as the best android handset while it s a fine smartphone it s not the unqualified success it aspires to be and it s regrettably held back by software that never works as well or as easily as it should first the hardware the american version of the s iii packs qualcomm s 1.5ghz dual-core snapdragon s4 processor this seems odd since the phone is available with a quad-core processor outside the u.s just like htc s one x but stateside consumers actually aren t getting shorted that hard chances are you won t miss those extra cores as the dual-core s iii is still a mighty phone launching apps watching high-definition video loading websites multitasking everything i threw at the new samsung was handled with no sluggishness or hesitation the s iii also features 2gb of ram unlike the 1gb ram setup found in the one x but while the s iii clearly had plenty of horsepower i saw no discernible power advantage over the one x both are fantastic performers and equally top-of-class in this regard when it comes to size the s iii barely undercuts the one x and the iphone 4s with its 0.34-inch thickness and at just 4.7 ounces it s plenty lightweight too the 4.8-inch 1280 x 720 pixel super hd amoled display is massive a thin bezel around the display keeps the phone from feeling oversized but this is still about as big as i d want a smartphone to be using the s iii with one hand isn t easy and many apps simply require the attention of two hands the display is sharp and bright with colors that feel a bit over-amped reds greens and blues often pop brighter on the s iii than on other handsets if you ve regularly used the galaxy s ii you re probably used to this contrast on the display is great with deep blacks that make the handset a solid choice for watching video the screen uses a pentile subpixel arrangement that unfortunately results in discernible pixels and a jagged look that falls short of the screens found on the iphone 4s and the one x i m also not a fan of the s iii s physical styling the pebble blue and ceramic white colors the s iii is offered in look sharp the blue especially which is closer to purple and the phone s plastic chassis feels solid as though it would withstand enough abuse to survive a 2-year contract but the tooling is all slopes and rounded edges leaving the handset looking more like a forgettable blob than the flashy flagship phone for the most popular android maker but hardware is just one half of the story here the major differentiator between the s iii and its competitors really lies in the software samsung s add-on software concentrates heavily on file sharing but the apps are difficult to use photo by peter mccollough/wired the galaxy s iii ships with google s android 4.0 ice cream sandwich operating system with samsung s touchwiz user interface on top of that samsung has added a special lock screen that simulates water ripples when you swipe it and water-themed sound effects are dribbled throughout the phone it has a voice-recognition system samsung calls s voice which is the company s challenger to apple s siri while s voice is advertised as being able to do a few things siri can t do such as launch a camera app or a voice recording app i couldn t get it to do much of anything s voice was a dud for me on two different review units samsung sent me a blue s iii running on t-mobile and a white s iii running on at amp t the most i could get s voice to do was say hi nice to meet you the most i could get s voice to do was say hi nice to meet you when i said hi galaxy to either phone if i said hello galaxy it would respond with i m not sure what you mean by hello galaxy every other request or command i spoke to s voice was met with network error please try again on both handsets despite seeing full service bars and being connected to wi-fi maybe it s just a problem limited to my two s iii s i brought this issue up with a samsung representative and i m waiting for them to get back to me but at this time i can t say that s voice looks ready for prime time and it s not coming close to matching siri s performance the other software features worked pop up play allows video stored on the s iii to play in a pop-up window just like picture-in-picture on a tv so you can watch a video and perform other tasks at the same time it works well but i didn t find the feature terribly useful on the handheld screen of a smartphone this idea seems more at home to me on a larger screen device such as a tablet where you could watch a video and email or tweet at the same time hopefully samsung is thinking the same thing facial recognition on the s iii works well whenever i shot a photo the s iii prompted me to identify faces based on contacts from my address book once a person is tagged it s easy enough to share the photo with them using a feature samsung calls buddy photo share just tap on the person s face and the s iii presents you with the option of calling that person or sharing the particular photo via text message email or by way of social networks such as facebook or google a couple of hits and a miss so far but when i dove into the sharing features the software experience got stickier take allshare a feature that allows you to share photos and videos with as many as six other s iii s that are nearby but when you send out the invitation to set up a sharing group it requires each person in the group to accept your invitation one by one also in allshare while users can see the files you re sharing they can t save them each of the sharing features comes with its own rules and limitations and each requires the user to learn a completely new set of behaviors they feel like they were all developed in isolation rather than in concert if you want to share photos with other galaxy s iii owners and let them keep the files you have to use a different feature called share shot which automatically distributes the photos you re taking by sending them over wi-fi to other s iii handsets on your local wi-fi network but share shot is a pain because invitations to join the sharing group are sent to other users one at a time each user in the group is prompted in turn to accept or decline the invitation and each must respond before the next user is invited it s easy to imagine a scenario at a party where users are standing phones at the ready to join a sharing session but everyone s being held up by a single individual who received the invitation before them and isn t paying attention to their phone it d be easier if each user could accept an invitation independent of the others which is what samsung allows users to do in another feature called group cast this sharing app allows s iiis to share photos pdfs and powerpoint presentations between phones but once again you can t save documents in this feature each of the sharing features comes with its own rules and limitations and each requires the user to learn a completely new set of behaviors they feel like they were all developed in isolation rather than in concert while buddy photo share share shot group cast and allshare are cool features to have the whole sharing scheme is far far more complicated than it needs to be samsung should really just give us one easy way to share anything we want but instead we have more sharing options than most users will probably be willing to keep track of it looks more like a forgettable blob than a flashy flagship phone photo by peter mccollough/wired samsung has also needlessly altered google s built-in android features google has developed an android-to-android sharing system called android beam that allows two nfc-equipped android phones to share files when the two devices are tapped together the s iii arrives with that feature intact but samsung also has added its own nfc sharing system called s beam which does the same thing but only works with galaxy s iii phones the ability to create folders on the s iii is also needlessly complicated in google s unaltered version of android 4 a folder is created whenever two app icons are dragged on top of one another on the s iii you have to hold your finger on the screen tap add to home screen from a pop-up menu select the folder option then drag your apps in carrier availability sprint june 21 t-mobile june 21 at amp t june 21 verizon july 10 us cellular late july but not all the software stuff is inscrutable some things are really helpful when you re composing a text message on the s iii and then bring the phone to your ear it automatically dials the person you were messaging another feature called smart stay uses the s iii s 1.9-megapixel front camera to detect when you re looking at the phone or not when the s iii sees you looking at it the screen remains active if you look away the screen will time out and go dim as usual last week i reported on another of samsung s nfc strategies tectiles which are tiny stickers with chips inside of them using an android app you program them to perform specific actions like send a text message or set a reminder place the stickers in physical locations like on your desk or refrigerator and you can just tap your phone against one to initiate the pre-programmed action unlike s beam tectiles work with any nfc-capable android phone even though tectiles launch was timed to coincide with the debut of the s iii there are also a number of slick photo modes built into the s iii s camera the rear shooter is a very capable 8-megapixel unit that s paired with an led flash photos aren t as sharp or as detailed as those i took with the one x but they comes close the camera app has built-in face detection a burst shot mode and modes for hdr pics macro shots and panoramas there s even a slick mode called smile shot which takes a photo anytime somebody in the frame flashes a grin the bottom line is that while all of samsung s software features on the s iii aim to impress and several display great ambition too many of them suffer from frustratingly poor execution thankfully you can just skip this stuff and enjoy the hardware samsung is still offering top-of-the-line performance here and the galaxy s iii is more capable than many of the other phones on the market even if it s a bit clumsy but as a whole package the s iii simply doesn t feel like a finished product it could use more polish more thought and a more elegant user experience wired a blazing fast beast of a phone with 2gb of ram and a 1.5ghz dual-core processor the display is a beauty just short of the iphone and one x screens handset is thin and light the same hardware is sold across five u.s carriers at the same price point tired samsung s touchwiz software includes a lot of half-baked features that aim for innovation but miss the mark sharing apps in particular styling is boring and not exciting enough for a flagship phone '),(270,'2012-11-16 00:00:00',8.8,47,' conclusion we like it the nexus 7 built by asus in close partnership with google is without a doubt the best 7-inch tablet currently available and even better at just 200 it s among the most affordable tablets you can get it packs in numerous features typically available only on higher-end devices including a sharp 1280 x 800 display and a fast quad-core processor and given the fact that it s the only tablet to run the latest version of android jelly bean it s easy to see why the nexus 7 is far ahead of other budget tablets such as the amazon kindle fire and the samsung galaxy tab 2 7.0 but that doesn t mean it s perfect the 200 model has just 8gb of storage and lacks a microsd expansion slot which you ll probably need if you want to load up some movies and android s tablet app ecosystem is still not nearly as robust as the ipad s but there s no 7-inch ipad at least not yet nor is there another 7-inch android tablet that offers so much for so little '),(271,'2012-11-13 00:00:00',8.3,47,' cnet editors choicenov 12 slide 2 slide 3 slide 4 slide 5 slide 6 slide 7

best small tablet you can buy nexus 7 gets hspa some sun pictures 1-2 of 6 scroll left scroll right design aside from its new sim card slot and slightly heavier weight the nexus 7 with hspa is identical in look and feel to the original wi-fi-only version it s yet another black tablet in a long line of black tablets however it does its best to break from the cookie-cutter mold of most slates chief among those efforts is a leathery grippy back texture similar to what we ve seen on the acer iconia tab a510 but with both nexus and asus embossed on it it may not look like much but this seemingly small bit of design panache makes the tablet one of the most comfortable i ve ever held then there s the bezel held in portrait mode the right and left side bezels of the tablet are refreshingly thin while the top and bottom are thicker than what i usually find on 7-inch tablets while the thicker bezels can be useful as a place to rest your thumbs while holding the tablet they are a bit too thick for my taste and make the tablet feel needlessly long table.geekbox th table.geekbox tr.even .ratinggood .ratingaverage .ratingbad google nexus 7 amazon kindle fire hd barnes amp

a cost-saving measure but this simplified design also serves to make the tablet that much more approachable for the tablet layman android 4.0 the second if you ve seen android 4.1 on the wi-fi version of the nexus 7 visually you ll have a good idea of what to expect from version 4.2 it has the same controlled focused feel and is less intimidating to the uninitiated than the typical android tablet interface it also feels less constrained than its original implementation the now-familiar tray on the bottom of the home screen is by default filled with google services apps such as play music books youtube and magazines there s also a folder housing chrome as well as google maps google plus gmail and other services directly in the middle of the tray is the apps button swiping up from the home button and across the apps button takes you to google now google s predictive personalized helper the apps tray now features smaller icons than before credit eric franklin/cnet google now uses voice recognition to field queries and displays information such as the current weather local bus schedules and nearby restaurants you may be interested in the thought is that google now will give you information when you need it if it s 5 p.m and you re about to leave work it will conceivably update you with traffic information without you having to fetch it the information would just appear in google now at the right time i ve spent a few weeks using google now and while i can appreciate its value since i walk to work don t travel much and am not really into sports its usefulness to me is very limited the new new there are quite a few new features in android 4.2 some interesting and useful others just kind of cool first the gesture type feature is google s native os answer to swype i m not a swype user but i was impressed by gesture type s ability to accurately interpret my finger sliding and determine for the most part what i wanted to type it did however have trouble with the word badass which is kind of unacceptable to me tablet settings can now be accessed much more quickly simply swipe down from the top-right corner to reveal a tray of shortcuts including brightness wi-fi settings general settings battery life airplane mode and so on that smooth textured back kind of makes the nexus 7 s design credit eric franklin/cnet magnification attempts to take advantage of the screen s 1 280x800-pixel resolution after enabling in settings if you tap the screen three times in quick succession assets on the screen will magnify in the section where you tapped this is different from zooming which scales images and text and applies anti-aliasing to smooth things out magnify simply makes things bigger it s a nice feature for those with poor eyesight but i was disappointed by the lack of anti-aliasing daydreams is essentially an interactive screensaver that plays when the tablet is asleep and charging you can choose to display a clock colors jelly beans or my favorite implementation google currents stories from your feed will slowly scroll across the screen and tapping any of them opens the story in the currents app gmail gets a new design and a new awesome feature awesome to me at least when viewing your inbox you can now swipe messages away to archive them as a person who gets a lot of spam in his inbox this well-implemented addition is one of those details that seems small on paper but makes a huge difference to your experience thanks to its comfortable design and sharp screen the nexus 7 is one of the best e-readers out there credit eric franklin/cnet multi screen multi screen implements users accounts in android 4.2 simply add a new user from the settings gt users menu and follow the steps to setup an additional user account new user accounts and all content on those accounts can be deleted by the tablet owner the primary account at any time also any other user accounts on the tablet can accept updated app permissions on behalf of the additional account to switch to a new user you re required to enter the lock screen select the user icon and then unlock the tablet this is a less elegant solution than the nook hd s implementation of profiles which allows you to simply tap the user account at the top of the screen select your new user and watch your content change to the new user s content before your eyes continue to next page 1

tablet makers not named asus this is how you make a 7-inch tablet the nexus 7 the first tablet to wear google s nexus brand sets a new standard for smaller slates proving that just because it isn t as big as apple s ipad doesn t mean it can t be just as useful as fast or as fun if you ve been on the fence about android or tablets in general this is the tablet you ve been waiting for if you ve been on the fence about android or tablets in general this is the tablet you ve been waiting for while the nexus 7 isn t a full-on ipad-killer it far out-classes anything else offered in the 7-inch category and most 10-inch tablets too the nexus 7 does this by offering smartly designed powerful hardware and the best android tablet experience to date the hardware in this case was engineered by asus for those who only use their gadgets to surf the web check e-mail play games and update their social media feeds the nexus 7 might be an even better choice than an ipad given how much easier it is to carry around but the feature that will probably be the most enticing to consumers is the price the nexus 7 sells for 200 with 16gb of storage that s the same price as the amazon kindle fire and barnes amp noble s nook tablet at the same storage capacity if you want a bit more room to download hd movies music games and apps you can get the 32gb version for 250 want always-on connectivity there s a 32gb version with hspa added for 300 at these prices the nexus 7 is frankly a steal when you compare it to what else is out there at the same cost the 1280 800 ips touchscreen is beautiful it s the best display i ve seen on a 7-inch tablet and almost as good as the asus transformer pad infinity and the third-generation ipad it s not quite retina display quality but with a pixel density of 216ppi it s very close colors are balanced without being over-saturated a common issue on many mobile devices nowadays particularly those from samsung also absent are any software performance problems where the fire and nook suffer from unresponsiveness slow animations and stuttering screens the nexus 7 screams in fact google s tablet responds as quickly and scrolls as smoothly as just about any tablet i ve seen no matter the size it feels as fast as asus larger transformer tablets and it performs as smoothly as the ipad even when playing high definition games such as shadowgun or playing back hd movies basically the nexus 7 is a beast navigating around android 4.1 jelly bean yes this is the first jelly bean tablet is super clean there s no hesitation on the part of the nexus 7 when loading magazines books apps video games music or web pages update we expect the nexus 7 to receive android 4.2 as an over-the-air update before the end of 2012 this can be attributed to nvidia s 1.2ghz tegra 3 quad-core processor yep this is the first quad-core 7-inch tablet too alongside that is a 12-core nvidia gpu and 1gb of ram the only noticeable delay comes when you first turn on the nexus 7 there s a lag of a few seconds while your content loads into the interactive home screen widgets pre-installed by google the widgets show you what content books music magazines movies and tv shows is available in the google play store for you to consume via either streaming or downloading the various widgets give you a taste of what s on offer from google play photo by ariel zambelich/wired these widgets make extensive use of cover art so they are colorful and attractive they re easy to use expanding and contracting as you cycle through the various options most importantly they reduce a lot of the friction around finding stuff in google play both for content you ve already purchased as well as enticing new options the widgets are very much in your face and they clearly suggest that google intends to be your go-to destination for buying renting and streaming digital media the fire and the nook the nexus 7 s primary competitors which also follow the device as content portal philosophy also offer an array of entertainment options on their home screens but google s arrangement is far prettier to look and less intrusive amazon fire s shows a cludgy carousel of content and even that s better than the random assortment of book covers found on the nook s home screen these google play widgets come installed by default on every nexus 7 but you can easily remove them and use a fully customized android home screen of your own design if you re not into buying content from google you can download amazon s apps and get your stuff there you can still get netflix or hulu for video rdio mog spotify pandora and other music streaming services are there too this isn t a user experience that forces you to buy all your content from one storefront pages 1

sbn.openx.istablet else getting the nexus 4 for review was something of a treat for me i ve been anticipating the arrival of a follow-up and upgrade from the company s previous flagship device the galaxy nexus for a handful of very specific reasons in fact i ve held off on moving to other excellent devices with expectations of this mystery phone in mind while i have been largely pleased with using the samsung-produced nexus there are some irksome qualities to the handset a poor camera weak display and lack of lte for at amp t that have made me eager to switch when i had a chance to venture out to google s mountain view headquarters for a feature on the next phone i already knew a bit about what was next on tap we d covered a variety of leaks of the alleged new nexus a glass-backed device apparently made by lg the device turned out to be more than just what i d seen in leaks it s a robust handset with the all the bells and whistles you d expect and a design sensibility that suggests google is continuing to move in a smart direction with its hardware but there are issues like an alarming lack of lte which makes it tough to see how this stacks up fully against the competition still it s an interesting evolution of the nexus experiment an unlocked high-end device sold for the cost of what some other phones sell for on-contract with carriers for this market that kind of choice is relatively unheard of so should you go rogue toss contracts aside and pick up a nexus 4 or does google have to make peace with carriers before its phones can be considered viable alternatives quote.nexus video review video review hardware design hardware and design hands-on with the nexus 4 previous next view full gallery previous next jdocument.readyfunction j gallery3354199 .gallery the design of the lg-made nexus 4 is very much an iteration of the galaxy nexus that is you kind of can t tell the two apart if they re sitting next to one another on a table it s when you get closer that you begin to notice the differences and there are many significant differences for starters the device is made mostly from glass gorilla glass the screen is coated smoothly from edge to edge and it almost feels like the glass is melted over the sides google s head of user experience matias duarte claimed that the curved sides helped swiping left or right on the phone and much to my surprise it did seem to make things easier to shuffle around near the edges of the screen the back is flat glass with a holographic stipple pattern which you can t always see but looks playfully futuristic in the right light the two glass surfaces are joined by a soft touch band which wraps around the entire device giving it a solid weighty feel in your hand that glass covering is cause for concern however while testing the phone i accidentally knocked the device off of my dining table and onto a hardwood floor.. cracking the glass on the back it s a small fracture but had i just paid 300 for the device i would be irate and i m not sure what lg or google s policy is on replacement that glass covering is cause for concern the nexus 4 is a handsome but uninspired device button placement is the same as the galaxy nexus the sleep / power button is on the upper right side of the phone while a volume rocker sits on the left the sleep button feels a little bit too recessed for its own good and i sometimes had trouble getting it to respond to my taps the headphone jack is on the top of the device while the micro usb port sits in the center of the bottom edge on the back of the phone there s a small slit which houses a speaker and a camera and flash somewhat awkwardly placed towards the upper-left side of the backplate i prefer the centered placement of the galaxy nexus the nexus 4 is a handsome if relatively uninspired device since it s taking most of its design cues from the previous generation nexus it feels less fresh than something like the bold lumia 920 or htc 8x even htc s one x seems to be taking more risks than this phone while being more sturdily built the nexus 4 has some similarities to the iphone 5 in the sense that its design is an iteration of the model which precedes it however apple s handset comes off as considerably more polished and refined specs cameras display specs cameras display google says this is the fastest phone on the planet inside the nexus 4 shines with an impressive set of specs the phone s beating heart is qualcomm s snapdragon s4 pro clocked to 1.5ghz which google says makes this the fastest phone on the planet i m not sure that s an empirical fact but the device was extremely snappy it also houses a healthy 2gb of ram and is available in an 8gb or or 16gb version i tested the 16gb version there s no sd slot here so you re stuck with a relatively small amount of onboard storage especially on the cheapest version there s also a non-removable 2100 mah battery inside you ll find the typical compliment of wi-fi radios here 802.11 b/g/n bluetooth 4.0 nfc and interestingly built-in support for google s newest accessory a wireless charging dock that looks a lot like the palm touchstone one thing you won t find however is lte the device comes equipped with hspa radios which will work just fine on t-mobile or at amp t here in the states and on the majority of carriers in europe and the rest of the world there are no plans at the moment for any other variations of the phone that i know of the camera can produce vivid images with a relatively low amount of noise the phone has two cameras an 8 megapixel shooter on the back and a 1.3 megapixel lens up front for video calling the back camera worked well certainly much better than the galaxy nexus and was able to produce vivid images with a relatively low amount of noise and excellent color clarity focusing in on even close subjects wasn t an issue though i did at times wish that its macro capabilities were a little more robust than they are i sometimes struggled with getting close subjects to stay in focus often having to reposition further back to get the shot i was after google says it worked overtime on making sure low-light performance was improved on the nexus 4 and i m happy to say it is better than the last phone though not a quantum leap forward as nokia s new lumia 920 is the biggest changes in the camera aren t really about hardware however and i have a lot more on that in the software section of the review nexus 4 camera samples previous next view full gallery previous next jdocument.readyfunction j gallery3354583 .gallery speaking of improvements the display on this phone is big upgrade over the galaxy nexus super amoled screen which was often far too dim when set to auto-brightness seemed very over-saturated and did a somewhat poor job of cleanly reproducing text the 4.7-inch 1280 x 768 lcd display of the nexus 4 has no such trouble producing images that are clean and crisp in just about any light setting the slightly wider screen did a great job with just about anything i threw at it though i did still feel that it auto-dimmed too low in darker settings the display also seems to produce more washed out looking colors than competing lcd screens like the iphone 5 or one x it wasn t a huge issue but your twitter icon may seem weirdly devoid of life on the nexus 4 data call quality data and call quality i mentioned that the nexus 4 will not ship with lte radios and it would be negligent of me to not say how big of a difference this will make if you live in an area where hspa service is not operating at peak levels since i happen to be an at amp t user in exactly that situation i know exactly how it feels slow it feels slow in brooklyn where i did much of my testing my hspa connection maxed out at about 5mbps down and 2mbps up on the other hand a samsung galaxy s iii on lte hit crazy speeds over 25mbps down without breaking a sweat i don t know what other customers are getting on their t-mobile or at amp t connections but that disparity is similar to what i ve been seeing since lte first hit the market it s a massive gulf and one which i have trouble ignoring at this point last year i switched to the galaxy nexus on verizon for a time only to come back to at amp t and the hspa version after being frustrated by the lack of updates but i swore that my next device would have lte no matter what after testing phones like the iphone 5 lumia 920 htc one x and galaxy s iii it s nearly impossible to imagine myself sticking with slower speeds as someone who uses my phone for business this isn t just about downloading big files it s about the device being responsive and quickly updating when i need something on android phones more than any other device on the market a solid and speedy connection can make the difference between a really good or really bad day when every service you use is connected to the cloud an extra 20mbps of speed goes a long way there s simply no way to ignore this deficit at least for the us market on the plus side call quality and reception was excellent on the phone i only had one dropped called while testing and general sound and clarity was top notch lg smartly equipped the nexus 4 with a loud and clear speaker and an earpiece that carries surprisingly clean audio the speaker was so loud that i actually had to turn the phone down for alerts i did notice a slightly audible but extremely quiet buzzing sound occasionally when i was on calls but it s possible that that s just a frequency i ve been not hearing due to the somewhat muted sound of the galaxy nexus earpiece there s no way to ignore the lack of lte performance performance and battery life performance and responsiveness is second to none as i stated above google says the nexus 4 is the fastest phone around right now whether that s true or not i can say that performance and responsiveness on the device is second to none it s a very speedy phone that barely ever hesitated or failed to respond to my touches or commands in particular multitasking between a number of applications was no issue for the phone buoyed up i presume by that generous 2gb of ram battery life was also top notch i m used to getting just about a day of use on my galaxy nexus that s taking it off of the charger around 8am or 9am and putting it back on around 2am some days it doesn t quite make it that long depending on my workload the nexus 4 fared much better at the time of this writing i ve had it off of its charger for 10 hours and 30 minutes and it s still got 45 percent battery life yesterday before i plugged it in i d had it off the charger for 16 hours with 18 percent of its juice left to say it s holding up for full work days would be an understatement even with heavy use this battery more than pulls its weight software software the software inside the nexus 4 isn t the kind of overhaul that ice cream sandwich was in the galaxy nexus in fact it s a dot update to jelly bean bringing the current version up to 4.2 that s not to say there aren t some significant changes here and google is definitely continuing to polish and refine an os which is increasingly impressive and innovative android is increasingly impressive and innovative camera probably the biggest updates in 4.2 are focused no pun intended really on the camera google has completely revamped the way in which you interact with the shooter now offering a wildly clever circular menu which can be activated by touching anywhere on the screen in the camera app the contextual circle lets you quickly swipe in a variety of directions to tweak individual settings making quick changes dead simple google engineers told me they wanted users to have an easier time taking pictures using only their thumbs and they ve definitely accomplished their mission it worked well for me though because it s so easy to touch and swipe while tapping to focus i accidentally switched settings a couple of times while taking pictures it does take a little getting used to the nexus 4 also now has an hdr photo mode which produces great results with surprisingly fast processing if hdr is your thing and google has greatly improved its photo editing options making tweaking your images easier and faster than before i mean you ll actually want to use it now the android team has added some smart little details like being able to swipe across your image while editing and compare the changes and a now includes a history of all your alterations that you can view while working on an image it s intuitive and works flawlessly but perhaps the biggest addition in the camera is the inclusion of a wild new shooting mode called photo sphere which makes panorama shots frankly look like a thing of the past the easiest way to describe the functionality is to say it s like having the ability to take your own street view photos.. pretty much anywhere it can be a little tricky to get all the angles right but google provides a fairly helpful guide which steps you through the process and when you do get it right the results are surreal once this features hits the public i m sure we ll see all kinds of crazy images appear gmail elsewhere the company has brought a much-needed update to gmail and after four versions of the software it will now automatically scale messages to fit within the width of your window that means that gmail has joined the ranks of the iphone and windows phone in this basic functionality and it will alleviate a lot of headaches for android users no more pan and scan imagine that google has also added a handy swipe to delete or archive function in the messages list which i took advantage of at every opportunity it s not the most original addition but it s one that makes dealing with an unruly inbox a bit easier and like many of the updates in this version of android is focused on one-handed operation details a new method of input has been included with the keyboard a mode called gesture typing which is basically swype without swype it works in conjunction with the standard tap keyboard you can mix and match with ease and makes one-handed typing roughly a million times easier i don t know how swype feels about this did google.. swipe the technology from them but it s a pleasure to have on the already excellent jelly bean keyboard bonus it will auto-predict your biggest strings like email addresses with enough practice a helpful dropdown menu called quick settings that lives in the notification window lets you get to your most-used toggles now brightness bluetooth airplane mode etc without deep diving into the settings list you can also get to these by using a two-finger swipe from the top of the screen i ve been using this menu constantly since i got the phone and it s one of the simplest yet most useful additions to the software and there are little details like this all over android 4.2 for instance there s a new menu in your call log that lets you sort calls by type missed voicemail outgoing etc a small tweak but one which i found incredibly helpful google has also added an easier way to use an emoji keyboard if you want to do something like that speaking of details i d be remiss if i didn t mention the terrific looking new clock app in 4.2 i know i know why should anyone care about a clock application well there has been a lot of fuss over clocks lately and i think google has done an impressive job here of updating what was previously a rather mundane and simplistic app with something that shows the company is truly invested in design and thoughtful interaction it typifies the kind of minimalist clutter-free layout which seems to be becoming the norm for first-party android offerings one suggestion though please make that snooze button a little bigger a bleary-eyed sleeper needs a big target there are little details all over google now / voice search finally google has put even more weight and science behind its extremely helpful / somewhat creepy predictive search thing google now the card-based app has added the ability to scour your email looking for beacons from flight and hotel reservations and then serve up that information when the time comes say day of travel or day of check-in the cards can also remember if you ve searched for a movie and remind you about the film when it opens will tell you about dinner reservations you ve made ping you about events you re interested in and even track your packages for you and tell you when they ve shipped as before and perhaps more than ever it works with remarkable sagacity google has also improved its voice search in both quality of results and look and feel and it now more closely resembles google now in my testing google voice search outperformed siri in the majority of queries and not only did it get the answers correct and offer up perfectly worded responses but it did so faster than its nearest competition sometimes by a longshot all in all the changes in android 4.2 may seem subtle but they come together to make a more cohesive enjoyable and responsive mobile operating system android may still have a slightly steeper learning curve than ios or windows phone but what you get in return for a little bit of extra effort is phenomenal in just over a year the os has gone from a nice-but-flawed experiment to a sleek sophisticated and incredibly smart platform i don t feel any hesitation in saying that the pure android 4.2 experience is at least in my estimation the most advanced mobile operating system on the market issues one thing worth noting here besides all the terrific changes in android 4.2 i did notice a couple of software issues with third-party apps the latest update of pocket seems to crash on launch any.do a to-do app i use often would flicker when i had it open and speedtest seemed to not be scaling properly to the screen of the nexus 4 while it worked fine on my galaxy nexus and a galaxy s iii i m testing with i m sure these are rather simple issues to clear up but they were a bit troubling to me wrap-up compare it lg nexus 4 8.3 verge score 8.9 user score write review good stuff improved build quality android 4.2 is fantastic excellent price for a device of this caliber bad stuff lacks lte screen a bit washed out glass backing breaks easily it s easily the best android phone on the market save for one small thing the nexus 4 is absolutely wonderful but it s also vexing frustrating annoying it s easily the best android phone on the market right now and has some of the most powerful software that s ever been put on a mobile phone it s an upgrade from last year s galaxy nexus in every way it s terrific save for one small thing in the us a flagship phone without lte is like a muscle car with no wheels for other networks in other countries and for the lucky t-mobile customers out there that are getting great speeds on its hspa network great no problem go get this phone but for others many others it s hard to imagine buying this device when you know it s a generation behind in terms of network technology a little over a year ago i bristled at the fact that the iphone 4s didn t have lte but i also admitted that the phone was a still a force to be reckoned with the same can be said for the nexus 4 with a caveat the mobile industry has changed a lot in the last 12 months lte is the norm not a nice-to-have and its performance has shown the cracks in the aging gsm networks of the us no flagship device is released without it not even the iphone for a phone and an os built for the cloud i think it s unacceptable to not offer a version that takes advantage of our fastest mobile networks if you buy the nexus 4 you have to decide whether you re willing to compromise data speeds for the purest and best form of the android os after comparing the options and seeing the gulf between google s flagship and other devices on the market i ve decided it s a compromise i won t be making again the breakdown more times than not the verge score is based on the average of the subscores below however since this is a non-weighted

lg have created one of the best android smartphones yet and have made it available at the incredibly low price of 299 without a contract the nexus 4 has a bright high-resolution 4.7-inch display the latest version of android a fast quad-core processor wireless charging a good camera and nfc for mobile payments and other close-up data-transfer functions because it comes unlocked you can use it with any gsm carrier in the u.s that primarily means at amp t or t-mobile without signing up for a long-term contract something that comes at a much higher price with most other phones an unlocked iphone 5 starts at 649 while the nexus 4 is a great phone it does have some faults the biggest one being its lack of support for high-speed lte data networks show morethe nexus 4 also has limited storage capacity and its battery life isn t on par with some other newer android phones if you re a heavy data user on at amp t which has a growing lte network you may be better off with an on-contract phone such as the samsung galaxy s iii a gdgt must-have which is currently available for 100 with a two-year contract when purchased through amazon wireless however if you re looking for a cutting-edge contract-free smartphone and can get along without lte the nexus 4 deserves to be your first choice '),(277,'2013-03-11 15:35:34',8.3,49,' lt cdata util.loadscriptasync http latform.linkedin.com/in.js gt jump to up top video review a love letter to a smartphone ultrapixels marginal power returns new sense wrap-up comments down close if sbn.openx.istablet else the android market has changed radically in the past couple of years where we once had a spec war with manufacturers racing to release ever-more powerful smartphones as quickly as possible now it s turning into a marketing battle and samsung is winning by a mile htc by comparison isn t doing so well the company has learned some important lessons about not flooding the market with iterative designs and the culmination of that is the aptly-named htc one it s htc s flagship the one device it s putting all its weight behind it might seem a little reductive to only consider the htc one in comparison to samsung s as-yet unseen galaxy s 4 but the truth is that the htc one can only succeed if it can steal back some of the marketshare it lost last year when the one x which we found superior to the galaxy s iii in many ways failed to compete with samsung s device the playbook this year looks surprisingly similar the htc one has top-notch hardware design and specs that are as good or better than anything else on the market today but that s long been the case with htc and it hasn t been enough so instead the company is making two gigantic bets a surprising camera that rethinks how you take photos and custom software that reimagines the home screen both features are likely to be polarizing but the real question is whether the buzzwords features and htc s technical innovation add up to enough to convince consumers to give the phone a chance a quick note htc tells me my review unit isn t a retail model that should mean only that it s not in retail packaging but it s possible that there are slight software changes coming over time i ll update here if that happens video review a love letter to a smartphone a love letter to a smartphone htc one hands-on pictures previous next view full gallery previous next jdocument.readyfunction j gallery3851767 .gallery i use a lot of different phones and over time they ve all sort of blended together big plastic slabs that look and feel as if they all came from a single design meeting two years ago it s been a long time since i had an instinctive visceral reaction like i did when i first took the one out of its box the one is gorgeous the aluminum slab s design is both totally unique and somehow still understated htc did a really clever job of making the phone s various parts double as its design flair the front-mounted speaker grilles give the phone a rugged industrial look and the edge-to-edge glass looks sleek and polished the aluminum front and back plates the device comes in black and silver though i much prefer the silver model i tested are joined by a matte white plastic siding that i worry might get dirty over time but as i ve used it so far i haven t had any issues two strips of that same white plastic run across the back breaking up the aluminum backing so the internal antennas can send signals out there s also a big camera lens plus htc and beats logos and a bit of fine print there s a volume rocker on the right side and a headphone jack and micro usb port this doubles as micro hdmi via mhl on the bottom i kept inventing excuses to use the one just so i could hold itat first glance it s beautiful but a bit cold and inhuman lots of clean lines and sharp edges plus at more than 5 inches tall it s just a big phone but the one is actually incredibly comfortable to hold the slightly curved back nestles into your palm and the chamfered edges slope from back to front so your hands curl naturally around its sides there are a couple of awkward ergonomic quirks like the top-mounted power button that is always impossible to reach on such big phones and especially the home button that s far enough to the right that it s hard to hit unless you re holding the phone in two hands even if i never did stop pressing the center-located htc logo trying to go back to the home screen the one feels a lot better than most phones this size and i did eventually learn how to shimmy the phone up and down in my hand to reach the various parts of the screen and body luckily i haven t dropped it while doing so but even if i did i suspect the one could handle it better than many of its more fragile counterparts like the nexus 4 htc keeps besting its own hardware efforts once you turn it on the one gets even prettier its 4.7-inch 1920 x 1080 display that s 468 ppi is the sharpest i ve ever seen whether you want to call it retina or something else i m sort of surprised htc doesn t have a goofy name for it the fact remains that the screen is tack-sharp colors are fantastic blacks are impressively deep and it looks great from any angle it s not notably better than a device like the droid dna but that s not a bad thing phone screens are getting really really good and the one s display measures up in every way well every way but one oddly the screen doesn t get very bright and it can be hard to see outdoors in sunlight but i m a master of the shield-your-phone-from-the-sun move so that didn t bother me too much by itself the screen makes the one a great option for watching movies or playing games but the front-firing speakers above and below the display take things to a whole other level with the phone held sideways the two create a surprisingly powerful and wide stereo effect more importantly they get loud enough that you don t have to hold the phone up to your ear to hear anything a pose i m glad to no longer have to strike there s some beats processing going on and for once it does seem to help the software adds some low-end where the speakers otherwise lack it and fills out the sound profile a bit the whole setup is called boomsound and while i despise the marketing term i love the effect make no mistake these are still phone speakers and i still use headphones more often than not but the one s audio setup is a huge leap beyond virtually every other smartphone or tablet at the risk of repeating myself i love the look and feel of the one htc gets what samsung doesn t fit and finish really matter and great hardware makes the one pleasant to use in a way samsung s slippery plastic frames just aren t i always try to use a device exclusively when i m testing it but nearly always come back to my iphone because i just enjoy using it more while using the one i all but forgot i even had another phone ultrapixels ultrapixels a bold bet but it doesn t totally pay off when htc introduced the one it skimmed across a lot of what seem like important features yeah it s big and pretty and has a nice screen whoop-de-do have we told you about the camera that camera is the feature on which the one s marketing power and ultimate success may depend it s called an ultrapixel camera and though that s almost entirely a marketing term it does signify a different approach for htc instead of trying to best the iphone 5 s 8-megapixel camera or compete with the insane 13.1-megapixel sensor in the sony xperia z htc went the other way the one has a 4-megapixel camera but htc promises that s a good thing these larger pixels can take in up to three times more light which should improve the low-light performance substantially since it s collecting fewer data points per shot the camera can also shoot faster apply filters faster and share to the internet faster htc one sample pictures previous next view full gallery previous next jdocument.readyfunction j gallery3851795 .gallery strictly speaking all those claims are true the one does capture a lot of light and takes surprisingly bright images with a 16 9 aspect ratio instead of 4 3 by default which you should change where my iphone 5 captured only darkness and thanks to its optical image stabilization it can basically see in the dark and take steady photos it s also really fast to apply filters or switch scene modes and it shoots so fast i sometimes didn t believe it had actually taken a picture the speed also allows for a cool feature called zoe which takes one second of video before you press the shutter and three seconds after it s actually shooting video and stills simultaneously and then stitching them together so you can scrub through the video but then grab a full-res still from whatever spot you want it s a cool tool and helped me get some really great action shots i definitely would have missed otherwise though i definitely forgot to turn it off a few times and ended up with about forty photos of buildings when i just meant to shoot one less useful is the htc share tool which lets you soundtrack and upload highlight videos of zoes videos and still shots to the web it s cool but it s kind of like vine except your clips only last a few months and no one s ever going to use it of course you can also upload to facebook and the like and that s a much better option that s all nice to have but it doesn t change the fact that the pictures i took on the one just don t look very good sure shots are bright and colors are good but it s clear noise reduction processing is running roughshod all over the photos you take leaving them soft and mushy even in good lighting nothing looks sharp or crisp no matter the situation things look fine at facebook or instagram sizes which htc is clearly betting is all you need but when you zoom or crop photos lose a lot of their luster i like the shots i m able to get with the one s camera i ve started taking more pictures in dark restaurants or on the street at night but i m not always impressed with the shots i get 1080p video footage is a more consistent beneficiary of the new technology since you re never really going to zoom in on video the one shoots clean bright video even in bad lighting and though there are some issues with softness and noise it s much less noticeable here it s fast and responsive when recording only taking about a half-second to switch modes and start rolling the autofocus tends to hunt a bit while you re shooting but all in all i m happy with the video performance on the one marginal power returns marginal power returns i m fairly confident there s a kitchen sink inside the htc one this phone has everything else certainly with nothing but high-end specs across the board it starts with qualcomm s new quad-core snapdragon 600 processor a remarkably powerful chip clocked here at 1.7ghz there s also 2gb of ram inside plus the standard set of radios and sensors bluetooth 4.0 nfc wi-fi dlna miracast an accelerometer gyroscope and gps there s even an ir blaster embedded in the power button just for good measure it all makes the one an impressively powerful phone across the board its benchmark scores are off the charts a quadrant score of 12 189 is more than double most phones from even a few months ago and in practice the phone is virtually flawless even playing asphalt 7 heat an intensive racing game that makes most phones stutter and drop frames was near-perfect on the one plus the speakers go a long way toward making you feel like you re driving a car bigger than something you d find at toys r us the only performance problems i had are the same ones no android phone has solved like the stuttered and jumpy scrolling in chrome i don t blame htc for that i blame google but google s fixing its problems and htc doesn t really cause any this phone performs beautifully this much horsepower is overkill until apps can take advantagei didn t get to test an lte version of the one i m using the unlocked european model and in exchange for actually affordable plans and the ability to use any phone you want our european friends are for the moment without lte i used an at amp t sim card in the one though and found reception and call quality to be as good as i d expect if anything the one picked up signal in a couple of subway stations and cave-like rooms i didn t expect the one s noise cancellation is really good muting street sounds the iphone 5 let through though the sound quality was only average speakerphone is really good because the speakers are really loud but the microphone wasn t overly impressive basically it s a cellphone a good cellphone maybe but still a cellphone for all the things the phone does well it doesn t do much of anything for very long the combination of a fast processor high-res screen and always-updating software is an ugly one for battery life and indeed i struggled to make the one last a full day there s a power saver mode that helps a lot but it also cripples the phone it turns off most of your wireless connections when you turn off the phone s screen for instance which seems like a steep price a couple extra hours of power the sony xperia z has a similar feature but it smartly lets you whitelist apps that can still operate i d be much more interested in this feature if i could make sure my email and twitter were still pushing updates in more practical use you re going to want a charger nearby since i killed the battery with about ten hours of tweeting browsing emailing and not that much else this is an unpleasant sadly unremarkable side effect of big screens and fast phones but s a shame nonetheless update there s been some debate about the battery life on the one and a few people wondered if i d gotten a bad unit htc shipped me a second and i re-ran a lot of tests to see if anything was different first i ran the verge battery test our standard test that cycles through a series of popular websites and high-res images with brightness set to 65 percent the one lasted 4 hours 48 minutes a decidedly average score it s slightly better than poor performers like the droid dna 4 hours 25 minutes but a long way from our battery life favorites the droid razr hd 9 hours 35 minutes and the razr maxx hd 12 hours 43 minutes streaming the 103-minute ferris bueller s day off over wi-fi from netflix also burned 58 percent of the device s battery if you re using it normally which means relatively lightly it should last you a whole day but the one is a decidedly average performer when it comes to battery life new sense new sense two things have been universally true of android phones over the last few years stock android is the best android and htc s sense skin is bloated and overwrought the one certainly can t change the former i immediately missed the clean and cohesive look of android 4.2 on the nexus 4 plus the features the one eschews by only offering android 4.1.2 but it does soften the sense blow htc s skin s biggest fault was always that it slowed down an otherwise speedy operating system and that s not really the case here aesthetically there are still some frustrating changes like the cartoonish icons in settings and a few ugly app icons but throughout the ui htc has exercised some much-needed restraint though in case you forget what you re using that flipping clock widget is only a couple of taps away this time instead of re-skinning android htc re-thought it in a very windows 8-like move the company decided that our home screens are an underused space why have a desktop full of icons and shortcuts they seem to be asking when you could fill it with actual content htc answers with blinkfeed a flipboard-like news reader that occupies your entire home screen basically you pick a bunch of news sources full disclosure the verge s parent company vox media is a blinkfeed partner or connect to twitter and facebook and your phone s home screen becomes a constantly updating list of stories and updates you might want to read it s a handy tool sure but i really don t like having it there every time i unlock my phone it s like having someone shove a newspaper in your face every time you open your eyes and left me overwhelmed by the idea of turning my phone on you can t turn blinkfeed off entirely but you can set another panel as your home screen and i found having blinkfeed s news one screen away was really nice for when i had a couple of minutes to kill for those moments it s great for the moments when i don t have those couple of minutes to kill i much prefer the normal home screen blinkfeed is handy at times but it s an exhausting home screenonce i changed that swapped the app drawer from its ios-aping custom sorting to alphabetical and set it to show more than nine apps at a time i didn t have much trouble with sense a lot of things about sense aren t necessarily worse in fact some like the tiled multitasking menu are better they re just different when they don t need to be the worst offenses are when htc seems to have refused to decide how best to do something so it just offers every imaginable solution in the people app you can navigate by swiping or tapping or long-pressing and it just gets confusing how best to do something it makes android feel unintuitive in places it really doesn t have to and gets away from the cohesive design philosophy android has cultivated over the years i learned to ignore the excessive options and just go about my day but it s kind of a disservice to how usable and smart android can be android s notification system already far outstrips ios and htc adds a couple of things i like even more there s a notification led embedded in the top speaker grille which shows when you have a message a missed call and the like you can customize it too to only see what you want to see you can also set the one to show certain notifications on the lock screen and then swipe the icon up to launch straight into the proper app it s really handy for seeing text messages and neatly combines the strengths of both ios and android s notifications there s not much bloatware on the one i tested though that s almost certain to change once the american carriers get their bloat-loving hands on the device look no further than the droid dna for an example this model comes with a few third-party apps like soundcloud and tunein radio and adds or redesigns a handful of first-party apps too i really like the google tasks-syncing tasks app the notes app that lets you take audio and written notes simultaneously and even the news amp weather app despite its apparent total lack of connection to blinkfeed the best add-on is the tv app though which works with the ir blaster to control your whole home theater system it s not a particularly elegant app it s basically an ersatz version of peel combining a basic on-screen remote control with a visual tv guide but it s easy to set up and has already come in handy a number of times when my actual tv remote was either lost in the couch cushions or just too far away for my lazy self to go get sense can t beat stock but it s not so far behind anymore wrap-up compare it htc one 2013 8.3 verge score write review good stuff gorgeous hardware beautiful high-res display fast consistent performance bad stuff mediocre camera poor battery life sense still has some issues as good an android phone as you can buy but samsung might have something to say about that i really really like the htc one i m a sucker for beautiful hardware and this device is one of the best-designed smartphones i ve ever used htc s done great hardware before though and ruined it with ugly and problematic software this time it s manageable not great not as good as stock android but manageable here the problem lies with the camera maybe i m in the minority when i say i care about the quality of my cellphone images but i do and the one just doesn t deliver its battery life is also disappointing though i m not as concerned about that it s just a fact of life at this point in my quest to find the perfect android phone i m still left wanting i want the one s hardware but i want the nexus 4 s software and promise of timely updates i ve said for a year that htc should offer stock android phones and i m still convinced the company could save itself with the one plus pure android i also want a better camera the one isn t bad it s just mediocre and i ve seen better from android phones for now the list of android phones worth buying is two items long the nexus 4 and the one personally i d buy the one if i had to choose right now but with the galaxy s 4 coming in just a few days i m pretty lucky i don t have to choose right now even if samsung can t best the one later this week though the most important question is still unanswered can htc find a way to sell a phone even a great phone when samsung has so dominated the android market until it does it won t matter how good the one is but for consumers sake and htc s i hope the company figures it out the breakdown more times

ambitious left me wanting still the one is largely a delight especially if you re the demanding sort when it comes to superior hardware finish and raw performance if you re looking for a new android phone for use on a 4g lte network it would be a mistake if you didn t consider it the new htc one boasts an all-aluminum body that s truly gorgeous the new htc one boasts an all-aluminum body that s truly gorgeous in fact the attention to detail seen in the design of the entire phone is spectacular frankly it needs to be apple s iphone still defines smartphone design language and samsung s marketing muscle is delivering massive sales meanwhile htc has seen its sales nose dive over the last couple of years the company needs a hit and it knows it this month it s putting two big bets on the table the first a 100 at amp t phone with facebook home pre-installed and the one a 200 multi-carrier flagship device meant to compete with the best offerings from the other hardware giants like last year s one x and one x the one follows the bigger-is-better trend in screen size the phone s display a 4.7-inch touch panel with a 1920 1080 resolution and a density of 468-pixels-per-inch is a stunner it s bright and renders colors faithfully and both text and images are remarkably clear it s a bit dim in direct sunlight not so dim that it s unusable but dim enough to be annoying and make you cup your hand over the screen to see it clearly above and below the screen rows of pinholes have been machined into the case beneath these grills are notification lights and more importantly a pair of front-facing speakers this is a very cool addition hold the phone in landscape mode to watch a video and you get a decent stereo audio image the one s speakers won t replace your jambox or your earbuds but they are the best built-in smartphone speakers i ve ever heard they re good enough that a speakerphone conversation actually sounds natural and not like a tin-can-and-string arrangement other notable hardware appointments the plastic power button doubles as an ir blaster so you can use the phone as a tv remote and charging is accomplished through a standard microusb port on the bottom the cellular and wi-fi antennas sit hidden behind two thin strips of plastic that arc across the back of the phone even here where plastic and metal meet the phone feels nearly seamless photo by ariel zambelich/wired the guts are top-of-the-line a 1.7ghz quad-core qualcomm snapdragon cpu 2gb of ram an nfc chip bluetooth 4.0 and lte connectivity the only reason it really has that quad-core chip is because other flagship phones like the samsung galaxy s4 have one the same reasoning is likely behind the inclusion of the 1080p screen the bar for smartphone hardware specs has been set and htc feels compelled to meet it never mind the fact that most apps aren t built to take advantage of a quad-core processor or a full-hd display but this future-proofing isn t a terrible thing after all these phones are being sold on two-year contracts and if i get the immediate benefit of a very very speedy phone then i m in no real position to complain right well unfortunately those over-spec d internals really give the battery a beating if i wasn t using the one much i could make it through a workday with maybe 50 percent of the charge left on the 2300 mah battery that s not too bad but most of us touch our phones dozens of times per hour and on the days i was using the one as my primary device i found myself reaching for the charger before the workday was over i even had the one die on me a couple times while grabbing dinner or drinks after work just because i didn t plug it in for a recharge at some point during my day this was the case on both the u.s lte model i tested an at amp t phone and the international hspa variant if you buy the one you ll want to buy an extra charger to carry around this is sadly a common piece of advice given to owners of 4g lte smartphones

one pictures 1-2 of 11 scroll left scroll right pricing and availability the htc one will be sold by three of the four major u.s cellular providers it s rumored -- but not confirmed -- to be coming to verizon later this year as well here s how it stacks up on each carrier prices shown are with a two-year contract at amp t htc one 32gb 199.99 64gb 299.99 4g lte simultaneous voice and data black and silver color options available april 19 sprint htc one 32gb 199.99 4g lte black and silver color options available april 19 t-mobile htc one 32gb price not announced 4g lte available april 24 htc one developer edition 64gb 649 4g lte unlocked sim and bootloader available april 18 we used the silver 32gb version of both at amp t s and sprint s htc one for our review as well as an unlocked international model design rectangular flat and extremely thin the htc one is practically all screen its 4.7-inch 1080p lcd display uses what the company calls solux technology for improved picture quality and generates 468 pixels per inch ppi this says htc helps the one s screen boast the most impressive viewing experience of any phone it has ever created since the display is slightly smaller at the same resolution the one s screen has a denser pixel count than the droid dna 5-inch 440ppi the same goes for the samsung galaxy s4 which uses a larger 5-inch oled screen 441ppi the htc one s design is thin metallic and striking credit sarah tew/cnet i can certainly verify that the one s display has plenty of impact with vibrant colors wide viewing angles and plenty of brightness details also look extremely crisp which makes me eager to stack the one s display against that of the galaxy s4 i suspect that samsung s latest monster will offer higher contrast and brighter colors but the jury is still out until i place both handsets side by side htc also makes a big deal about the one s all-aluminum chassis describing it as using a zero-gap unibody design indeed available in black and silver the handset feels sturdy has reassuring heft and its smooth metallic skin exudes high-end craftsmanship htc also took pains to point out that while the thin white trim encircling the silver model i manhandled appears to be plastic it is in fact metal the htc one has an all-aluminum frame credit htc in another interesting twist dual speakers one on each side of the screen act in unison to deliver a more lively audio experience for watching movies or listening to music paired with an onboard amplifier and beats technology htc has given the system the rather unfortunate name boomsound it reminds me of the kind of cheesy trademark philips used to plaster all over its old boom boxes that said the one s speakers do pack a hefty punch producing rich audio with a satisfying helping of bass the phone s audio system has wide stereo separation as well plus a surprising amount of volume in fact i found that i could rely on the one s speakers in a pinch when my portable bluetooth speakers weren t handy while nowhere near as loud as say a jawbone jambox or jabra solemate the phone provides enough audio oomph for small groups in quiet rooms above the display sit a 2.1mp front-facing camera and a notification light below are just two capacitive android buttons while a headphone jack and volume button are up top what s really interesting is how the power button also doubles as an ir blaster to control home theater equipment a volume rocker is placed on the right side and a sim card slot holds court on the left on the bottom edge sits the phone s micro-usb port around back is the 4mp main camera and led flash which also uses htc s ultrapixel sensor software ui and features the htc one has all the power of modern android 4.1.2 jelly bean at its disposal it may not be the freshest jelly bean flavor available 4.2 but you do get all the tight integration with google s wide range of software and services that modern android phones enjoy these include gmail e-mail google social networking google talk google drive and so on plus access to over 700 000 apps for download through the google play store layered on top of android is yet another version of htc s sense ui as is typical for this sort of added interface the latest version of sense offers more enhancements you may or may not find useful the first is something htc calls the blinkfeed a main home screen consisting of dynamic tiles that display content from a wide variety of news outlets blogs and web sites including cnet if you re familiar with popular news aggregators such as flipboard and pulse then you get the idea there are drawbacks to blinkfeed that you should be aware of most notably that you can t turn the feature off at least not entirely by default the blinkfeed screen is set as the phone s primary home screen you can however select any of the htc one s home screens as its starting point another annoyance i ran into is that blinkfeed pulls content from a stable of vetted sources while that s fine for casual news viewing you ll probably run into roadblocks trying to tweak it to display more-targeted outlets the htc uses a cleaner tighter sense ui credit brian bennett/cnet i admit that i like the revamped sense user interface besides blinkfeed the skin has a cleaner look with icons that are less crowded across and within the app tray also odd is that unlike in stock android jelly bean the app tray doesn t side scroll it scrolls vertically the scrolling motion also jumps through icons by the page not smoothly at a set rate which takes getting used to also gone is htc s iconic weather clock widget which has graced its phones since way back in the days of windows mobile you will still find information for time and weather forecasts at the top of the home screen but displayed in a much more low-key fashion an icon here and on the lock screen displays current conditions by taking the shape of a sun clouds and so on it will even blink at you with eye-catching animations such as falling rain or snow blinkfeed is front and center on the htc one credit brian bennett/cnet confirming that the line between tablets and smartphones is blurring more every day the htc one also features an ir blaster on its top edge when used with the htc sense tv app and htc remote software users can control their tvs with the phone while keeping tabs on local programs set up htc remote to control tvs and home theater gear credit brian bennett/cnet i have to say this feature comes in handy more than i would have originally thought after going through the simple if rather lengthy setup process which asks you to lay out the tv channels you receive in detail i was able to control my home theater set effectively that means switching channels via my cable box adjusting volume on my onkyo receiver plus opening the guide to sift through available programs what s also pretty slick is how i can tap icons of shows i have marked as my favorites to immediately begin watching them if they are currently on view what s on tv now right from the htc one credit brian bennett/cnet other useful apps software tools you ll find on the htc one include a task list maker plus a voice recorder something many phones lack as well as kid mode kid mode locks the handset up tight along with all your apps and services and only lets tykes access a special kiddie view complete with age appropriate games and distractions handling media duties are typical android apps such as play music play movies plus htc watch which offers htc s own selection of video and tv content to rent or buy the free tune-in app a personal favorite streams internet radio but the phone also has an fm tuner i like htc s homegrown music player too it s intuitive and easy to use plus it has a slick visualization function if you re into that sort of thing continue to next page 1 2 editors top picks 2 apple iphone 5 at amp t sprint verizon starting at 199.99 4.0 stars 3 samsung galaxy s iii s3

up top video review hardware display cameras software performance wrap-up comments down close if sbn.openx.istablet else big phones are getting bigger this trend doesn t seem to be slowing down in the least and the new htc droid dna for verizon wireless is the latest member of the giant smartphone clan priced at 199.99 the dna has more than just size on its side it s also the first smartphone with a crazy high-res 1080p display to be available in the us but a hdtv-equivalent display alone does not a great smartphone make and the droid dna attempts to be the best on other fronts with a cutting edge quad-core processor 8-megapixel camera with wide aperture lens and the android 4.1 jelly bean software the first truly high-end htc device to be offered by verizon wireless since the ill-fated rezound the dna has to contend with the likes of samsung s galaxy note ii motorola s droid razr hd and razr maxx hd apple s iphone 5 and the latest volley from microsoft with its new windows phone 8 devices does the droid dna have what it takes to stand out from the pack or will it and its fancy new display be lost in the sea of black slab smartphones on verizon s shelves read on to find out video review video review hardware hardware and design verizon s black and red motif strikes again htc droid dna pictures previous next view full gallery previous next jdocument.readyfunction j gallery3417655 .gallery continuing the trend of slab-style all-touchscreen smartphones the htc droid dna is little more than a giant touchscreen laid on top of a thin frame housing its internal components and cameras decked out in verizon s signature red and black color motif the dna is not an unattractive device by any means but it doesn t exactly wow you with its design the phone is solidly assembled though it lacks the unibody construction of htc s one x / one x and it s all plastic instead of mostly metal like the evo 4g lte the lack of metal certainly aids in the dna s light weight at 5 ounces 142g it s significantly lighter than you might expect a device with a 5-inch display to be for comparison last year s rezound was a stout 165g and it has a notably smaller 4.3-inch screen the tapered back helps mask the dna s massive sizewhile the front of the dna is dominated by gorilla glass 2 the rear of the phone is comprised entirely of a soft-touch material the soft-touch finish feels nice and helps you keep a grip on the phone but it also attracts a good amount fingerprints dust and pocket lint so it s not the easiest to keep clean the back is also home to the 8-megapixel camera lens and led flash and external speaker my favorite feature of the dna is the notification light located on the back of the phone which might be one of the most novel things i ve seen on a smartphone in a long time the multicolor led is located just to the left of the camera module and is virtually indistinguishable from the surface of the phone when it s not blinking there is also a small notification light tucked in the speaker grille on the front of the dna so whether you have the phone placed face down or face up you can see if you have notifications waiting i m a big fan of notification lights on smartphones so the fact that the dna has two where many other phones have none puts a smile on my face fiddly port cover is fiddly the back of the phone also features a gently tapered design that helps mask the large size of the device though the dna is listed as 0.38 inches thick the tapered design brings it to a rather thin 0.16 inches at its sides the sides perforated red panels htc calls it a micro-grill pattern that are meant to evoke a sports car the volume rocker is inset in the panel on the right side of the phone and while its placement feels less natural to me than if it were on the left it works well and i didn t have any trouble using it as mentioned the droid dna is a large phone at 5.55 inches tall and 2.78 inches wide it s definitely at the bigger end of the smartphone spectrum but it s not much larger than the already big one x or evo 4g lte one-handed use with the dna can still be a chore despite the tapered rear design and minimal borders around the display as is the case with all of these massive smartphones i frequently missed tap targets in apps when i tried to reach them with my thumb that s certainly not a unique trait of the dna and if you are interested in this particular device you are probably well aware of the ergonomic limitations that come with such a massive display but not all is rosy with the droid dna s design power / sleep / unlock buttons have always been hit or miss on htc s smartphones the windows phone 8x s power button is nearly unusable and i m not a fan of the placement of the button on the one x but the location of the droid dna s is a new low or a new high if you will since it s located in the middle of the top edge of the phone which might be the most awkward place it could be on a phone of this size there is no easy way to press the button without shifting the phone in your hand and assuming a ridiculous claw grip with your index finger on top of the device somebody really needs to tell htc s designers that power buttons work best on the side when phones have 4.3-inch or larger displays motorola samsung and lg have all figured this out so it s time that htc got on board my complaints with the dna s design don t end with the power button either instead of just leaving the bottom-located micro usb port open and accessible htc decided to put an infernal protective flap over the jack making it far more difficult to access whenever you need to charge your phone the silly little flap is fiddly to remove and fiddly to put back in place when you remove the usb cable and its frustrating every time you use it this idea wasn t good on the palm pre back in 2009 and it s not good on the dna in 2012 fortunately the droid dna supports wireless charging with qi-compatible accessories so you don t need to use the micro usb port if you own a compatible charging pad don t expect to find one in the box with the dna however display display the real star of the dna s show is its 5-inch super lcd 3 display the dna is the first phone in the us to feature a 1080 x 1920 pixel hd display and it s quite stunning there s something to be said when a smartphone has the same number of pixels as the vast majority of hdtvs available on the market today and the dna s 440ppi pixel density means that you can t see individual pixels no matter how hard you try color reproduction and viewing angles are easily best in class and the dna has no problems outdoors in bright sunlight like the one x s slcd 2 display the air gap between the glass and the lcd on the dna is so small that it almost looks like images are floating on the screen multiple people in the verge office asked if the device was a dummy unit and not a real phone thanks to the display s impressive visuals we ve long praised htc s own one x as having the best display on any smartphone but the dna s new slcd 3 panel bests it without much effort i don t think there are enough superlatives to describe how good this screen is it s really something you just have to see in person to appreciate fully there aren t enough superlatives to say how good this screen is cameras cameras wide angles and speedy performance but not the best in low light htc has equipped the droid dna with two cameras the 8-megapixel rear unit mentioned earlier and a 2.1-megapixel front-facing camera borrowed from the windows phone 8x the front-facing unit can record 720p hd video and has an exceptionally wide 88 degree field of view so you can fit the whole family in the frame when you are video chatting with grandma the rear camera features htc s imagesense processing chip and software which offers the ability to shoot 1080p video and capture stills at the same time without any interruption of the video capture htc s camera interface is the best in class for android manufacturers and it s been enhanced on the dna with a larger shutter key and easier access to the front-facing camera and zoom control for low-light photos the dna has a f/2.0 lens to let in a lot of light but it doesn t have a fancy optical stabilization system as found on the nokia lumia 920 pictures taken in low light are good but they aren t quite as good as those offered by the iphone 5 or the lumia 920 for everyday photos in decent lighting the dna takes respectable shots that most people should be fine with software software the droid dna features android 4.1.1 jelly bean with the latest version of htc s sense 4 interface sense 4 is very similar to sense 4 and should look quite familiar to anyone that has seen htc s phones released this year htc customizes android with its own lock screen home screens app drawers and multitasking system and it covers the majority of the interface with its own theming whether you like htc s treatment of android generally comes down to personal taste but for the most part sense tends to bury android s functions under layers of unnecessary ui elements and it can be slower and more cumbersome to use as a result for example google now is buried under a long press of the home key which is much less intuitive to access than the swipe up gesture used in stock android 4.1 additionally sense s handling of the legacy menu button still found in many apps is less than elegant and the dna doesn t have the ability to change the function of its dedicated multitasking key like the one x in addition to the changes sense 4 brings to android 4.1 the dna is stuffed to the gills with pre-loaded apps from both amazon and verizon itself verizon has been putting amazon apps on its android smartphones since the release of the motorola droid razr m but the dna takes it to another level with a new single-sign-on widget that gives you access to all of your amazon content and services in one place this is great for those that rely on amazon s services for everything from books to music to shopping but it s a bit annoying that it s built into the phone and not provided as an option for those that don t want it the droid dna may be a glimpse into the future of what a real amazon phone might be like but it s at this point the amazon features feel more bolted on than truly integrated into the system other crapware apps preloaded on the dna are verizon s nfl mobile viewdini verizon tones vz navigator visual voicemail slacker radio and amex serve apps while it is possible to disable most of these apps it s not possible to remove them from the phone s memory which at 16gb about 11.5gb are available to the user is already on the smaller side of things one thing to note about the dna s software is that it is entirely phone-based unlike the samsung galaxy note ii which offers some tablet experience and the s pen for more functionality the dna offers more or less the same software experience as any other htc smartphone from 2012 despite its larger display the dna is very much a smartphone and isn t really a replacement for a small tablet by any means performance performance htc has outfitted the droid dna with a qualcomm snapdragon s4 pro quad-core processor clocked at 1.5ghz and paired with 2gb of ram that s the same setup that we saw in the lg nexus 4 and optimus g and the s4 pro is one of the fastest smartphone chips ever released the dna scored well over 8 000 on the quadrant standard benchmark and a staggering 71fps in the glbenchmark offscreen 1080p test but in everyday use it becomes apparent that the higher resolution display taxes the processor a bit more than a 720p screen might while most operations are very fast and there aren t many stutters in the interface there are instances where scrolling is not as smooth or responsive as it should be this is especially noticeable in the chrome browser but it can also be seen in numerous other apps as well the dna just doesn t feel as fast as the nexus 4 in pretty much everything despite its very high benchmark scores data performance on verizon s 4g lte network was as usual very good with speed tests easily hitting 20mbps down and 17mbps up on numerous occasions call quality was not as impressive however as the earpiece did not get loud enough to carry on a conversation while walking down a busy city street like many other htc smartphones the droid dna comes with the company s beats audio processing software and hardware enhancements htc claims that the dna s 2.55v dedicated headphone amp provides better sound with less distortion and noise that offered by other smartphones in my tests audio played back from the dna through a quality set of headphones was good but it wasn t remarkably better than the sound that my iphone 5 produces likewise the external speaker wasn t exceptionally loud or better than other smartphones on the market the dna has a 2 020mah battery that cannot be swapped or replaced when it runs empty the nexus 4 was able to impress us with its efficiency mostly thanks to the s4 pro chip but with the dna it s apparent that the faster lte connectivity and much higher resolution display have a detrimental effect on battery life the dna lasted a meager four hours and 25 minutes in the verge battery test which cycles through a series of websites and high-res images with the screen at 65 percent brightness in daily use it frequently tapped out long before the day was over it s certainly a phone that requires a trip to the battery charger at least once possibly even twice during the day to make it to the evening unfortunately you have to deal with that frustrating plastic flap that covers the micro usb port every time you need to charge up which will be more often than you would probably prefer benchmarks are incredible but performance hiccups slow the dna down wrap-up compare it htc droid dna 7.7 verge score 8.5 user score write review good stuff screen is best in class thin and light design comes with android 4.1 out of the box bad stuff battery life is terrible occasional performance hiccups sense 4 buries much of what is good in android 4.1 the droid dna offers a great screen but carries some fatal flaws the htc droid dna does a good job of impressing you on the surface the 1080p screen is to die for the svelte design minimizes the phone s large footprint and it sports one of the fastest processors you can get in a smartphone today it s also the best smartphone htc has had on verizon in a long time but once you get beyond those initial impressions the cracks begin to show the dna offers a lot for the 199 asking price but the miserable battery life and occasional performance hiccups are reason to pause before hitting that purchase button a great display alone unfortunately cannot make up for the dna s other problems verizon users looking for a new android smartphone have a number of other options at their disposal including samsung s still relevant galaxy s iii and motorola s pair of droid razr hds but if you must be the guy with the highest resolution display on the block the droid

slab-shaped htc droid dna looks like just about every other android smartphone on the market step closer though and the signature verizon red highlights jump out at you while the handset is clad in stealth-bomber black it s trimmed with red metallic stripes on either side htc says it was inspired by lamborghini supercars when crafting the dna as for me i just think the stripes which are iridescent and perforated by tiny holes look futuristic and striking the htc droid dna boasts a big bright and colorful 5-inch super lcd 3 screen credit sarah tew/cnet measuring 5.6 inches tall by 2.7 inches wide the device is large yet thin at 0.38 inch thick and a mere 0.16 inch thick at its thinnest point its profile makes its edges thinner than the samsung galaxy s3 picking up both handsets and placing them side by side however they seem to be of equal thickness or shall i say thinness this phone is razor-sharp there s no doubt about that and its metal buttons and trim give it a much more premium feel than the galaxy s3 s plastic parts the htc droid dna is trim despite its large size credit sarah tew/cnet above the screen is a 2-megapixel front-facing camera capable of shooting video

the htc droid dna s 8-megapixel camera lens credit sarah tew/cnet display what further enhances the droid dna s waferlike dimensions is how the display s glass extends to the handset s edges this helps the phone disguise the fact that it s packing a massive 5-inch super lcd 3 screen not only is the display bright it boasts a sharp 1080p resolution which htc claims translates into 440 pixels per inch text and details in photos and video looked crisp and colors vibrant while it s not as oversaturated as the samsung galaxy3 s amoled screen colors were more accurate but popped less even so

dna is still a traditional smartphone it falls into our definition of a phablet and we re sticking to it that puts the dna in direct competition against the likes of the 5-inch lg intuition and the 5.5-inch samsung galaxy note ii rather than traditional smartphones like the 4-inch apple iphone 5 and the 4.8-inch samsung galaxy s iii view all 7 photos in gallery but make no mistake the htc droid dna walks a fine fine line between smartphone and phablet though the display measures 5 inches there are very narrow bezels which keep the phone narrow it measures 5.55 by 2.78 by 0.38 inches hwd and weighs 5.01 ounces which is awful close to the galaxy s iii at 5.38 by 2.78 by 0.34 inches and 4.69 ounces in fact when you put the two phones next to each other they look a lot closer in size than say the droid dna and the galaxy note ii which measures a whopping 5.95 by 3.17 by 0.37 inches and weighs 6.34 ounces .zd-video function c if window.jwplayer document.readyfunction k new array f .extendc jwplayerthis.id.setupf loading.. among many phablet fans the idea persists that bigger is better if that s how you feel the dna may be a little too small for you but if you re in the smartphone camp 5 inches is definitely on the large side the droid dna feels comfortable to hold in one hand like a smartphone but you can t hold it and drag down the notifications bar using your thumb like a phablet categorization notwithstanding i ll bet that for some people a small phablet or huge smartphone is probably just right size aside there s no debating that the droid dna is one beautiful phone it has a unibody design that s made of matte black polycarbonate which gives the phone a soft grippy feel red accents abound in the ring around the camera on the earpiece speaker grille and on the sides of the phone which have the look of speaker grating but are just ornamental the entire front of the phone is five inches of glorious display coated with curved gorilla glass 2 which is both a pleasure to look at and swipe your finger across this phone has a much more luxurious feel than the plastic galaxy note ii more on that display the droid dna s 5-inch super lcd 3 has 1 920-by-1 080-pixel resolution that works out to 443 pixels per inch which handily beats every other phone available right now the galaxy note ii for instance has 267 ppi even the iphone 5 and its vaunted retina display has 326 pixels per inch if 326 pixels qualifies for apple s retina designation htc should call this screen x-ray vision it s just incredibly sharp text and images look fantastic and this phone was made for watching hd video the galaxy note ii s display looks positively grainy in comparison compared with the iphone 5 the htc dna s screen is sharper but it has a bluish cast and it isn t as bright still it s only noticeable when you put the phones next to one another and most people don t set their brightness to max so neither of these points should matter too much next page data speeds call quality and battery life back to top 1 2 3 '),(285,'2012-11-26 00:00:00',6.0,50,' photo by alex washburn/wired when you re contemplating the vast expanse of glass covering any one of the current models of smartphones with supersized screens you have to ask yourself how big is too big is a 5-inch display that much better than a 4.5-incher does native 1080p capability actually matter on a smartphone how big of an advantage does such a device earn ladies and gentlemen meet the htc droid dna its massive 5-inch 1920 1080 display has the same resolution as the best hdtv sets lining the shelves at your local retailer it sports a pixel density of 440 pixels per inch which bests all the big-name competitors the google nexus 4 320ppi the htc one x 316ppi and 8x 341ppi and the apple iphone 5 326ppi while a 1080p screen is mighty pretty it s not a killer feature on a smartphone and it does not make the device significantly better than the current crop of 720p-capable phones but while this looks great on paper it doesn t matter much at all seriously don t get me wrong the dna s display is gorgeous and arguably the best-looking smartphone display out there but to the naked eye and over a couple of weeks of daily use it doesn t look significantly better than the phones mentioned above and that s a good thing the fact is they all look great on any one of them pixels are indiscernible and text looks crisp and clean rivaling a printed page colors are vivid and bright photos video apps websites magazines every single thing displayed on screen is rendered beautifully the bottom line is that while a 1080p screen is mighty pretty it s not a killer feature on a smartphone and it does not make the device significantly better than the current crop of 720p-capable phones and this is a wonderful thing for consumers smartphone displays are better than they have ever been today we expect top-tier phones to come with retina-quality screens and anything less is deemed unacceptable while the dna s display looks stunning the size of the thing makes it difficult to use the phone with one hand while it isn t as audaciously oversized as the 5.5-inch-display on the samsung galaxy note ii the dna s touchscreen can still be a bit of a hassle the slightly smaller 4.7-inch displays on the nexus 4 and one x are far more comfortable even the 4.8-inch display on the popular samsung galaxy s iii is easier to use with a single hand and 4.8 inches is about the largest smartphone display that i ve been able to comfortably operate thus far it s here that the dna s display doesn t make it more useful but counts against it photo by alex washburn/wired another sticking point is the paltry battery life in over a week of testing the handset i wasn t able to make it through an 8-hour workday without having to charge up the 2020 mah lithium-ion cell before i headed home on the weekend while running errands and using google maps yelp twitter and the camera throughout the day battery life flew by and i found myself stopping to charge up by midday and again in the evening if you buy the dna you ll want to pick up a spare charger to go with it each time i had to charge up i was greeted by an annoying little plastic door covering the usb port on the bottom of the dna when this tiny door is closed the dna looks sleek and smooth but opening the door reveals a flimsy piece of plastic that feels like it s hanging on for dear life it feels like it s only a matter of time before that little door breaks off while everything else on the dna feels lovingly designed and well built this door is a weak point htc should have just left the port exposed as most phones do nowadays pages 1 2 view all '),(286,'2013-04-22 03:33:33',4.0,50,'Truly mediocre

updated since the original publish date to reflect changed features and bug fixes from various software updates and also includes final battery results we haven t seen so much buzz over a phone since the iphone but for the past six months all eyes have been on the palm pre introduced at ces 2009 the palm pre quickly became the most anticipated phone of the year not only for what it meant for palm and sprint--two companies struggling behind their competitors--but also for what the device promised the multitasking features the notification system a physical keyboard multitouch screen--all of these factors combined made it in our opinion the most legitimate rival to the iphone yet now here we are six months later and the palm pre is finally ready for release we ve spent the past few days poring over every detail of the device without palm s or sprint s supervision and we re prepared to answer the all-important question does it live up to all the hype well we d say our thoughts on the palm pre echo those we had for the t-mobile g1 there are some hardware and performance issues and we re concerned about a few missing features but we walked away impressed with the palm webos the tiny qwerty keyboard isn t going to draw any praise nor is the lack of an expansion slot we re also disappointed that the pre lacks some basic functions such as video recording and voice dialing though palm has said these features can be added later through an over-the-air update battery life is also a concern as the smartphone only lasted about a day on a single charge which in all fairness is about the same as the iphone all that said the pre s deck of cards multitasking functionality and notification system are what make it special and they are areas where the pre beats the iphone or any smartphone on the market right now in addition personal-information management is completely changed in a good way with the synergy feature while the pre finally gives sprint customers something to be excited about it won t please everyone early adopters gadget lovers and consumers who need or crave more functionality from their cell phone will be well-served by the pre though there is a little bit of a learning curve to the device also because of the battery life and that slight bit of sluggishness we d don t think it s the best device for business users or road warriors also despite some of the monthly savings of sprint s data plans we don t expect that many customers will switch to sprint just to get the pre especially in light of the news verizon and at amp t will eventually get their own models and a crop of hot new phones on the way starting from the ground up palm has really made a solid and smart platform and one that doesn t just match the capabilities of its competitors but offers something more in its multitasking and personal information management capabilities palm might not have completely knocked it out of the park with the palm pre but at least it s back in the game and we look forward to more webos devices the future the palm pre is available starting june 6 for 199.99 after a 100 mail-in rebate and with a two-year contract on sprint s everything data plan or business essentials with messaging and data plan in addition to sprint stores the pre will be sold at best buy radioshack and some wal-mart stores design the palm pre s design is unlike that of any smartphone we ve seen to date but if we had to give a point of comparison we d say it somewhat resembles the htc touch it s a bit like a pebble with its smooth black lacquered finish and rounded edges and like the iphone palm keeps it simple by keeping external controls to a minimum the face of the device only has one control a center button that will take you back to the deck of card view the center key is a bit deceiving in that it looks similar to a trackball navigator so there were times where out of habit we would try to navigate a page by trying to scroll up and down using the center button but you can only press it like a key on top of the unit there s a power button a silent ringer switch and a 3.5-millimeter headphone jack which we re always happy to see the left side features a volume rocker while the micro-usb port is on the right finally on back you ll find the camera flash speaker and removable battery palm pre is shown sandwiched between the google ion and the apple iphone 3g in its closed state the pre measures 3.9 inches tall by 2.3 inches wide by 0.6 inch thick and weighs 4.76 ounces it fits nicely in the palm of your hand and is certainly more pocket-friendly than the iphone some have worried about the durability of the phone since it s made of plastic we didn t throw it off a building or anything but we thought it felt quite solid not cheap or toylike the only negative things we d note are that the phone is a smudge/fingerprint magnet and the slider design can feel a bit rickety at times however the sliding mechanism is smooth and the screen clicks securely into place when pushed up there s a bit of a curve to the phone in its open state and we preferred keeping it that way when talking on the phone since it felt more comfortable against our cheek touch screen we have to say the pre s display is one of the main highlights of the phone it measures 3.1 inches diagonally so it s smaller than the iphone s and some other touch-screen devices such as the t-mobile g1 and the samsung omnia but what it lacks in size the pre makes up for in quality the 24-bit color hvga display is vibrant and sharp with its 320x480-pixel resolution images text and web pages all looked amazing we d say it s on par with if not just slightly crisper looking than the iphone s screen under the preferences menu there are settings to adjust the screen s brightness and backlight time you can also customize the phone with preinstalled wallpaper or use your own images and set them as your background the pre s vibrant touch screen is one of the highlights of the smartphone the pre s display has a built-in accelerometer so the screen orientation will automatically change from portrait to landscape mode when viewing photos videos and web pages the accelerometer is fast and changes pages without any lag there s also a proximity sensor which will automatically turn off the display when you lift the smartphone to your ear for a phone call the capacitive meaning it responds to the touch of a finger touch screen is pretty responsive there s no haptic feedback but white rings will appear around an icon or menu item to let you know that the screen has registered your touch to scroll through lists you can drag your finger along the screen or give it a quick flick to get through longer lists the onscreen dial pad is simple with large buttons and it includes shortcuts to voice mail and your call log of course you can also just use the universal search function and start typing a contact s name to get quicker results the pre s screen is multitouch which is a fairly big deal since the iphone has long stood in a class of its own with this functionality--but not anymore like the iphone the pre lets you zoom in and out on pages by pinching your fingers apart or close together double-tapping the screen will also achieve the same task in addition swiping left to right on an item such as an e-mail or call log number will give you the option to delete it to copy cut and paste just tap on the screen to place the cursor at the start of what you want to copy/cut press the orange key on the keyboard and drag your finger across the desired text you can do this anywhere on the screen by the way it doesn t have to be right over the words once you ve selected everything tap the upper-left corner of the screen to bring up the drop-down menu with your copy cut and paste options below the screen there s a gesture area where you can perform a couple of tasks which we outline in the section below two small leds and the center button will illuminate white to indicate that it has registered your command user interface and navigation we ll say it outright the palm pre isn t the most intuitive device to use at least at first when you fire up the smartphone for the first time there s a brief animated tutorial to familiarize you with the various gestures such as swiping right to left in the gesture area to return to the previous page the gestures are also illustrated in the quick start guide but even so it takes some time to learn all the various commands the home screen looks easy enough to understand with a simple tray along the bottom that includes shortcuts to the onscreen dialer contacts e-mail calendar and the main menu aka launcher pressing the launcher icon will bring you to all your applications and settings it consists of three panels that you can swipe from left to right and vice versa and each panel is dedicated to a more general category for example the first panel includes all the core functions such as messaging web multimedia google maps task list and so forth the second panel is focused on applications and sprint services and the third panel features the phone s various settings and options the user interface in general is very sleek and fresh and provided smooth transitions also it s more inviting and engaging than google android which will make it more appealing to consumers to launch a program you simply tap an icon and once you re in an application you can tap the upper-left corner of the screen to open any relevant menus for that particular app of course the beauty of the palm pre is the multitasking capabilities so you can simply launch another program without having to exit off the current one to do this drag your finger from the gesture area up to the screen and you ll see the home screen tray appear in a cool little wave from there you can move your finger to one of the dedicated shortcuts or open the launcher for a full list if you want to return to any running apps a press of the center button will bring you to your deck of cards view where you can simply select the card you want if you re wondering why the feature is called deck of cards it s because each application is presented in a card window and you can then shuffle through the open cards you can drag and drop cards or rearrange the order of apps in the launcher by pressing and holding the item until you see a halo around the card and then you re free to move it but it s not like with the t-mobile g1 where you can drag and drop icons onto the main home screen when you re done you can flick the card upward and that will close out the program as you can see there s a lot to learn but after a couple of hours we felt more comfortable and familiar with the gestures obviously with more use these commands will become even easier and soon you won t even have to think about it but when comparing the out-of-the-box experience of the pre with that of the iphone the iphone definitely wins for its ease of use that said we give props to palm for its connection manager by simply touching the upper right-hand corner of the screen you get instant access to the pre s connection settings--wi-fi bluetooth airplane mode--instead of having to go through several menus as on the iphone keyboard the lack of a physical keyboard was a big reason why some people chose not to buy the iphone there will be those who argue that the iphone s onscreen keyboard is fine and just needs some getting used to which is fair enough however there are also some who desire physical keys and don t want to give them up present company included so it was like a dream when the palm pre was announced at ces 2009 with its full qwerty keyboard fast-forward to now where we actually have the device in hand and we have to say we re a bit disappointed similar to the palm centro and palm treo pro the jellylike buttons are quite small and there s very little spacing between them in addition the top row of keys runs right up against the edge of the open cover so it s easy to bump into it when typing the palm pre s keyboard is less than ideal with its small buttons and cramped layout i was still able to type faster using the pre s keyboard than the iphone s but i also have small hands so it was easier for me to punch the keys however i can definitely see people with larger thumbs having problems and unfortunately there s no onscreen keyboard option at this point i took a quick poll of some co-workers and all agreed that the keyboard was small several called it a deal breaker but a majority said they could get used to it after a while continue to next page 1 2 editors top picks 1 htc one 4.0 stars 2 apple iphone 5 at amp t sprint verizon starting at 199.99 4.0 stars 3 samsung galaxy s iii s3

2817 2338899 00.asp so far so iphone but slide up the pre s screen to reveal the qwerty keyboard cradled in black plastic with a slightly sharp lip at the bottom the keyboard is more beautiful than comfortable because palm uses a clear gummy rubber for its keys so they re a bit sticky but the keys aren t too too small the pre s keyboard is actually wider than the one on the palm treo pro and much bigger than the palm centro s still it s not as good as a blackberry keyboard palm has kept stray buttons and ports to a minimum on the pre there s just a volume rocker on the left-hand side a micro usb connector on the right and a 3.5mm headphone jack on top the back of the phone houses the lens for the 3-megapixel camera and the speaker the pre works like a lot of smartphones do it s just a bit more fun the menu system is simple to grasp and it should take only 15 minutes roughly to learn some of the new interface tricks palm s innovation is cards hit the main menu button in the middle of any application to reduce that app to a card and start doing something else you can toss cards away that s quitting apps shuffle them or close and reopen them it s a beautiful well-conceived answer to the what programs do i have running question the brilliant card metaphor makes me want an entire deck of them meaning apps now we get to my number-one worry about the pre apple s done an excellent job of making people aware of smartphone apps with the 40 000 programs available for the iphone and as soon as you pick up the pre you re going to want to load 20 30 or 40 from its app store which is right on the phone but palm has been stingy with its software developer s kit so there are currently only a handful of apps once developers get the kit they may find it very limiting especially in terms of the deep hardware hooks required to make compelling games for the pre to succeed it needs as many collectible cards as pok mon next the pre s phone and e-mail prowess back to top 1 2 3 '),(289,'2009-06-04 00:00:00',8.0,51,' jim merithew/wired.com pre is an odd name for a device that drops late into a corporate drama already loaded with twists turns and setbacks but if palm is indicating that its new phone kicks off a new phase maybe the pre is aptly named after all shaped like a small bar of shower soap the dense ebony pre matches many if not all of the features of its chief competitor the iphone but in one key aspect the pre does the iphone one better while a lot of the pre s features a bright 3.1-inch touchscreen manipulated by taps swipes and pinches apps sold by third parties in an open online bazaar integration of e-mail contacts and calendar are now standard in 3g smartphones palm also lets users keep multiple applications running simultaneously it s a huge win the palm gets around the inherent difficulty of multitasking with a concept dubbed cards which work like windows on a regular computer when browsing open apps or web pages you swipe through the cards as if viewing photos tap on a card to use the app the other apps are still active your inbox still collects mail web pages still update just as with your computer you can stay constantly connected to facebook twitter im and other online activities best of all when you re using an app and need something from another app you don t have to go through a tortuous process of closing launching and reloading when you re navigating with google maps you can slide over to check a contact s address choose a podcast or answer an e-mail and then return to maps without losing a beat the pre also offers an extremely useful notification bar at the lower end of the screen that informs you of what s happening in various apps like new e-mails received the most appreciated example is the music player tab which tells you what s playing and even lets you pause or skip to the next song while you re doing something else the pre pays a price for all that labor a morning s worth of heavy use may leave the pre powerless by afternoon i ve been testing the pre for less than a week and typically the battery meter hits the red zone before sunset since the pre uses removable batteries though you can always pop in a spare palm acknowledges that battery use is a challenge and gives tips on power preservation also the temptation to keep many apps running can outstretch the device s ability to handle them i quickly learned to dread the dialog box informing me that i could not open a new app without removing some of my open cards it s like blackjack one too many cards and you re busted so you have you be brutal and keep closing cards you do this by flipping the card towards the top of the screen whereupon it disappears did ricky jay have a hand in this interface the pre s other big claim to innovation is its attempt to combine iphone elegance with blackberry efficiency at e-mail and other typing-oriented tasks so the pre s gorgeous compact form lustrous and small enough not to bulge your pocket also hides a tiny slide-out physical keyboard it s a compromise the keyboard s too small for thumb typing welcome to fingernail typing and makes handling non-alphabetic characters a bit difficult while i generated text more slowly than i did with the iphone my tweets and e-mails were more accurate i didn t have enough time with the phone to see if a moderate user could eventually produce text with machine-gun speed to compliment the sniperlike accuracy setting up on the pre is easy palm offers a variety of options including sucking contacts from facebook and gmail but the most useful way to do it is media sync which employs software from itunes when you plug the pre via mini-usb cable into a computer equipped with itunes the software thinks the new device is an ipod and lets you load songs photos videos and contacts into the pre but not movies and tv shows that you bought from the itunes store which are copy-protected not surprisingly this process occurs with apple-like ease the pre s 3-megapixel camera has an led flash and takes decent pictures it can t capture streaming video for now the device also has universal search that finds matches for keywords in the contents of the phone or on the web wikipedia or twitter and a killer synergy feature lets you aggregate im sms and e-mail messages with someone into a single threaded conversation generally the pre s software called webos is intuitive and effective still some flourishes are missing on the pre on the iphone phone numbers embedded in e-mails are highlighted so you can call with a single click not so here the external speakers sound anemic the software that auto-completes words and spell checks during typing isn t as helpful as the iphone s as with the iphone the pre s browser doesn t run flash no hulu the first version comes with only 8 gigs of storage pretty much the minimum acceptable and maybe it s because i ve been conditioned by the iphone but the pre seems to under-use its single button on the front panel employing it mainly for shifting between cards and apps and then there s the network depending on where you live sprint the pre s exclusive provider may be a boon or a deal-breaker in the palo alto california the location where i used the pre most calls were dropped so often that i finally threw my hands up and returned to the iphone to make a call but in san francisco the signal came in clear and on a road trip through central california sprint worked fine in some remote areas of course compared to the iphone the real missing pieces are those thousands of applications available on the app store one for just about anything as the commercials constantly remind us right now before the june 6 launch there are only about a dozen or so preview apps in palm s app catalog including an impressive version of fandango that skillfully integrates the pre s gps and web abilities palm claims developers will find it easy to create new apps for the pre and is banking on a thriving marketplace the company has not yet announced details on how you ll get apps from the marketplace onto your pre and the feature wasn t available for me to test the pre is priced competitively at 200 once you get back a 100 rebate the rebate trick is a low-rent consumer electronics sales stunt that palm should have passed on you will also need to commit to a two-year sprint contract which will cost you a minimum of 70 per month since the sticker price is reasonable and the device justifies a lot of its uh pre-release buzz it will probably be a hot item in the near future its long-term prospects though hinge on whether or not all those third-party apps will show up whether sprint can satisfy users and whether apple has something up its sleeve that counters the palm s gambits also of course the pre has to prove stable and reliable my test unit occasionally suffered opening-day jitters including a crash that was fixed only by taking out the removable battery palm originally found glory in the pda era then fared well in corporate smart phones but as of late has been pummeled by better smarter touchscreen- enabled handsets now led by an executive chairman with a pedigree from the company it hopes to challenge jon rubinstein who headed the division that created apple s ipod palm once again is making claims to be a contender even against the ali of high-tech the pre emphatically shows that palm has not reached the stage of suffixes and multitasking rules wired great look and superb feel well-conceived os with multitasking and instant notification physical keyboard utilizes itunes to load and refresh content tired multitasking puts a big suck on the battery sprint exclusivity will be annoying to palm-philes on a contract with at amp t verizon or t-mobile keyboard is puny if apple blocks the handset s access to itunes pre users are hosed '),(290,'2013-04-22 03:36:30',10.0,51,'Palm4lyfe!

jack as well that s admittedly not a lot of ports and there s no sd card slot to be found nor like the asus zenbook any minidisplay port converters to hook up external monitors or usb ethernet adapters you will however find a five-dot led battery life gauge on the right with a button to turn it on speaking of leds there s a tiny led bar up front that serves as a power white sleep pulsing white and low battery pulsing orange indicator silky smooth skin thankfully among the many things dell steals from apple is solid construction while the xps 13 doesn t have a unibody aluminum chassis like the macbook air it s practically as slick strong and streamlined as if it did as the rubberized magnesium alloy deck and carbon fiber bottom feel fantastic and blend nicely into the aluminum rim dell s recently been on a premium materials bent with the xps 15z and xps 14z featuring both magnesium alloy and aluminum in a reasonably sturdy shell but both of them look and feel chintzy compared to the xps 13 s lovely comfortable build the carbon fiber and soft-touch paint do a decent job of insulating palms and legs from the laptop s heat too and two lengthy rubber rails on the bottom keep the top-heavy teardrop shape from sliding off your lap when you re seated by the way if you re looking for regulatory symbols and the windows product key you ll find them under a locking metal flap on

and the slimmer bezel is swell but it s actually comparatively thick and on the heavier side as well it s easier to stuff into a bag than most 13-inchers but don t be fooled when dell tells you that it fit a 13-inch screen in an 11-inch chassis that s mostly marketing fluff screen / speakers screen and speakers gorilla glass can t protect your eyeballs from this lcd besides i m not convinced the tradeoff for that thinner bezel was a particularly good one the 13.3-inch edge-to-edge gorilla glass covered display looks great when it s turned off but as soon as you have to actually use the 1366 x 768 screen you can tell something s off the colors wash out as soon as you move your head the slightest amount blues turn into greys when viewed straight on both brightness and constrast diminish significantly if you move to either side and critically there doesn t seem to be a single position where the colors look good all the time it s also only 1366 x 768 resolution which isn t bad for a 13-inch screen but feels far less spacious than the 1440 x 900 panel on the macbook air or 1600 x 900 on the asus zenbook dell s speaker arrangement though is fairly grand just like with the macbook air the audio invisibly wafts up from someplace deep within the machine and the sound field it produces is actually even better it s remarkably full and clear for a laptop and gets plenty loud for a small room as you d expect there s no real bass some distortion at high volume and with my review unit the audio tended to glitch crackle and pop on occasion i m hoping that last one is an odd manufacturing defect but you might want to keep an eye out keyboard / touchpad keyboard and touchpad we ve been fans of dell s cushy slightly concave chiclet keys for a while now and the xps 13 s keyboard is no exception not only is it backlit unlike a number of ultrabooks but the little squares have sufficient depth and cushioning for decently comfortable typing they re still a little bit shallow mind you if you don t care for the macbook air keyboard this won t suit you much better still i ve written every word of this review on the xps 13 and i encountered no major issues i did however spend a whole lot of my time with the xps 13 fighting its terrible touchpad it s a single-button cypress unit no dedicated mouse buttons here and the surface actually feels pretty good unlike the tacky glass of the razer blade it s easy to glide a finger across the soft-touch surface and it s just as easy to physically depress the button as it is on the macbook air the problem is that the cypress drivers are all over the place i tried three different versions of the software and manually tweaked every setting i could and couldn t find a single combination that both allowed for smooth two-finger scrolling and decent palm rejection the pad is sensitive enough and close enough to the keyboard that it s almost impossible not to hit it as you type and the software s not always smart enough to keep you from jumping a line when you do there s no way to easily and quickly turn off the touchpad while you re typing and scrolling can be exceptionally jerky too also no matter which version of the software i used the cypress pad was sluggish to respond to gestures like scrolling pinch-to-zoom and tap-to-click which meant that the laptop only did what i told it to do after a noticible delay eventually i gave up and switched to a mouse i suspect you d do the same update dell s planning to release new touchpad drivers for the xps 13 soon and we can confirm that they fix a number of these issues we ll update this review when they arrive update 2 dell has released the a01 touchpad drivers and they re a lot better we ve created a new database entry for the improved xps 13 and given it a slightly higher score to match eventually i gave up and switched to a mouse performance / software software and performance there s nothing like a speedy ssd boot resume dell xps 13 17

battery / noise / heat battery life noise and heat with a subpar display and some iffy trackpad drivers the xps 13 really didn t need a third strike against it but here goes though dell quotes upwards of 8 hours 53 minutes of runtime i only got around 5 hours and 15 minutes of email and light web use in our verge battery test which automatically cycles through a series of popular websites and high-res images with the screen set to 65 percent brightness and with dell s intelligent display on which slightly adjusts brightness to match images on screen we were only able to eke out 4 hours 55 minutes of use from the sealed six-cell 47 watt-hour battery that s not bad by any means but it places the xps 13 practically at the tail end of the ultrabook pack both the lenovo u300s and the asus zenbook ux31 last a half-hour longer the toshiba portege z835 a full hour longer and it s far behind the 7 hours 7 minutes we managed with the cheaper and more fully-featured hp folio 13 most of the time the xps 13 runs pretty cool and i m happy to say it s not that noisy either the tiny fan has a distinct and fairly high-pitched whirring sound but since positioned in the hinge of the laptop and within the carbon fiber case the sound is moderately isolated when playing back 1080p flash video we couldn t hear the fan over the laptop s speakers at all the xps 13 s a good bit less noisy than the

gallery dell xps 13 the first very important laptop of 2012 has arrived in the form of the new dell xps 13 this is dell s first ultrabook an intel designation for laptops with certain specs--essentially a windows macbook air and even though the company is a little late to that particular game the xps 13 nails a lot of what makes for a good ultrabook experience at 999 for a 128gb solid-state drive ssd and intel core i5-2467m cpu the xps 13 is reasonably priced although hewlett-packard toshiba and others offer similar specs for 100 or so less working in dell s favor are the system s excellent build quality--the body is a mix of aluminum magnesium alloy and carbon fiber--and its smaller footprint it s not quite a 13-inch laptop in an 11-inch body but it s in the ballpark the backlit keyboard large touch pad edge-to-edge gorilla glass over the display and the small footprint all add up to an impressive package if the battery life and screen both image quality and resolution were better it could be the best of the current ultrabooks as it is it s still in the running but it s not a blowout win table.geekbox th table.geekbox tr.even .ratinggood .ratingaverage

about the xps 13 is how small it looks dell claims this is a 13-inch screen in a chassis more like an 11-inch laptop s in reality it s not exactly that compact but it is a bit smaller than other 13-inch ultrabooks it falls right between the 11-inch macbook air and 13-inch macbook air although with the bigger screen and edge-to-edge gorilla glass it feels dense when you pick it up for the first time it s heavier than you expect and the comparison to the macbook air is an apt one as this is the most air-like ultrabook to date more so even than the asus zenbook ux31 if not for the circular dell logo replacing the circular apple logo on the back you d be hard-pressed to tell the difference with the lid closed the bottom surface is more distinctive two raised channels allow heat to escape from a bottom vent but also raise the entire system by a few millimeters it s not as nice-looking as the all-over smooth body of the air the keyboard is shallow but very pleasant to use with a soft clack-free touch the backlight is bright but not overpowering against the all-black keys and keyboard tray something must be said for the all-over use of matte black as well the less glossy my laptop interior is the happier i am the glass touch pad is large with a drag-free matte surface but the tap sensitivity needed to be cranked up a bit for it to be usable and even then it still acted a bit wonky though arguably not worse than most other windows laptop touch pads one disappointment is the screen itself while the 1 366x768-pixel native resolution is what you ll find in most 13-inch laptops we ve seen 1 600x900-pixel models recently and the 13-inch macbook air has a 1 440x900-pixel display admittedly starting at 300 more edge-to-edge glass is always a look that i like but the off-axis viewing on this display is poor dell is purportedly going to offer a higher-resolution screen in the near future so hopefully it ll be an improvement table.geekbox th table.geekbox tr.even

that gives me pause is the lack of an sd card slot--the 13-inch air and most 13-inch ultrabooks have one many times a large sd card is an easy and inexpensive way to temporarily boost the capacity of a laptop with ssd storage you may also be bothered by the choice of displayport instead of hdmi for the video output which just isn t as universally useful sure an adapter can connect the two but even in corporate settings you re more likely to run into hdmi or even vga than displayport--for now at least the base 999 configuration with a 1.6ghz core i5 4gb of ram and a 128gb ssd should be fine for most for 1 299 the ssd gets bumped up to 256gb--more than apple will give you at that price--and a faster core i7 cpu gets added to the 256gb ssd at 1 499 an it-focused version of the xps 13 will offer corporate-friendly extras such as a tpm chip bitlocker data encryption and static images for companywide it groups that require systems to be identical even if purchased many months apart a casual consumer won t need to worry about these features the included intel core i5-2467m cpu is in the same category as the core i5-2450 or i5-2430 processors found in most current mainstream 13-inch or midsize laptops the xps 13 performed in the middle of the pack when compared with other similar laptops--overall differences were slight in anecdotal use the xps 13 felt fast and lag-free and is more than powerful enough for everyday multitasking only the intel hd 3000 graphics hold it back in terms of performance as you won t be able to play much beyond casual and social games but neither

the nearly bezel-free 13.3-inch display is covered in edge-to-edge gorilla glass that adds durability and looks gorgeous think of the best smartphone or tablet screen you ve seen view all 15 photos in gallery the overall effect is striking from the silvery aluminum cover to the metal plate on the bottom with etched windows and intel logos no stickers on the palm rest it s also sturdy with virtually no screen flexing and no vibration during typing our only complaint is that when closed there s almost no protrusion or screen edge to grip making the dell hard to open the screen settles for the 1 366 by 768 resolution that s the baseline among netbooks missing the chance to impress us with the 1 440 by 900 of the macbook air or the 1 600 by 900 of the asus zenbook ux31-rsl8 1 049 list 4 stars its viewing angles are slightly narrow once or twice we found ourselves wishing we could tilt the screen back a fraction further on the positive side the display s colors are vivid and it s exceptionally bright dell advertises 300 nits but we would have guessed more you can turn the backlight fully halfway down not just a notch or two without things getting dingy the eye-pleasing screen is matched by a finger-friendly keyboard with slightly scalloped keys and a precise slightly clicky design that avoids the too-shallow typing feel of some ultrabooks the keyboard lacks dedicated home

belkin screencast or netgear push2tv adapter speaking of audio the ultrabook s is surprisingly clear and crisp from being lavish with features however the xps 13 abruptly becomes a minimalist when it comes to input/output ports there s a usb 2.0 port and headset jack on the laptop s left side and a usb 3.0 port and mini displayport alongside a handy pushbutton-and-led battery gauge on the right you ll look in vain for vga or hdmi video for an ethernet port for connecting to wired office networks or for a memory-card slot as tempting as it would be to slip the dell into your digital camera

competitors manage at least an hdmi port dell sells a usb ethernet adapter for 30 and mini displayport to hdmi and vga adapters for 30 and 37 respectively so it s not the end of the world but it s a gripe if you dislike dongles after subtracting a system-recovery partition and the software preload the 128gb ssd has about 75gb free happily there s no bloatware to speak of unless you count skype microsoft office starter 2010 and a mcafee internet security trial dell boosts the xps 13 s one-year warranty with a year of in-home or -office service after remote diagnostics accidental damage service and lojack for laptops theft protection one of the xps 13 s neatest features is one that intel has touted as part of its ultrabook sleep instead of switch off specification but that we haven t seen in person before smart connect technology which lets the laptop periodically wake itself from sleep mode you set the interval from 5 to 60 minutes as long as it s connected to a trusted wi-fi or wired network to check your outlook email and calendar tweetdeck feed or other active applications so the latest data is waiting for you when you reawaken the ultrabook and return to work we tried it briefly with gmail and it worked like a charm we can see smart connect saving minutes every morning performance as mentioned earlier the dell xps 13 is built around a 1.6ghz intel core i5 processor the sandy bridge model i5-2467m and the same intel hd 3000 integrated graphics used in all ultrabooks to date the hardware posted first-class overall performance with a score of 3 535 in our pcmark 7 benchmark test ahead of the hp folio 13 s score of 3 146 and behind the asus ux31-rsl8 s result of 3 634 but our asus test unit had a slightly quicker 1.7ghz cpu instead of the 1.6ghz chip used in models on sale today the xps 13 also shone in the 3dmark06 graphics test though like all ultrabooks it s built for productivity instead of 3d gaming the system managed only 17 and 15.2 frames per second at medium settings in crysis and lost planet 2 respectively thanks to its ssd the xps 13 also boots up and resumes from sleep in a flash well a few flashes since we couldn t equal dell s claims of 8 and 1 seconds respectively booting from cold till the last taskbar icon appeared took about 20 seconds but waking from sleep took a snappy 2 seconds dell claims almost nine hours of battery life for the xps 13 unfortunately our mobilemark 2007 battery rundown test failed to run but based on the battery s size 47wh and our real-world testing we estimate about six and a half hours for real-world productivity work in strenuous or worst-case anecdotal testing word processing and web surfing in the foreground while windows media player looped a five-minute full-screen video in the background the xps 13 lasted 3 hours 40 minutes we ll update this review after we get mobilemark to run but the xps 13 s battery life seems in line with other ultrabooks update 3/2/12 our estimate was fairly close mobilemark 2007 reported a runtime of 5 hours 58 minutes that s in the ballpark with the asus ux31-rsl8 and macbook air 13-inch though it trails the 7 33 of the hp folio 13 there will be a flood of new ultrabooks coming with the arrival of intel s ivy bridge processor update this year but dell has set the bar very high without needing new silicon if it had just one or two of the missing ports we groused about say hdmi and a card reader the dell xps 13 would be spectacular as is if you don t mind carrying a dongle or two it s an ultra-small ultra-sophisticated choice that

snyder/wired dell s entry into the ultrabook world may not break any new ground but does it have to by covering all of the ultrabases in a good-looking package dell s xps 13 keeps up with the joneses while not really trying to show off the strategy works you ll find absolutely no surprises under the hood here as the xps 13 stays almost exactly in lockstep with the rest of the ultrabook market specs include a 1.6ghz core i5 128gb ssd hard drive 4gb of ram and a 13.3-inch screen with 1366 768-pixel resolution the gently tapered chassis features one usb 3.0 port one chargeable usb 2.0 port and oddly a mini-displayport connector landing right at three pounds it s an awful lot like a blacker and slightly smaller version of the macbook air performance tests drew no complaints or surprises scores were within the air s numbers within a couple of percentage points across the board plenty fast with general apps but simply unfit for graphics or gaming duty the only real weak spot in testing slightly sub-par battery life that didn t reach four hours when 4.5 to 5 hours is common for the industry overall it s a very attractive ultrabook that can almost go toe to toe with apple in the design department the little touches are nice including a handsome keyboard backlight a soft-touch palmrest and underside and surprisingly beefy speakers touch-typing on the island keys was easier than usual thanks to a slight depression built into the top of each key overall it s a very attractive ultrabook that can almost go toe to toe with apple in the design department speaking of design i only have a few complaints about the system first is the hinge it s so tight that you can t adjust the screen without the laptop tipping backwards but a bigger issue is the clickpad while it s big and spacious it didn t register taps half the time and pushing down on the pad to physically click required an inordinate amount of effort and usually caused the cursor to move involuntarily neither is a dealbreaker but both features could benefit from more thorough usability testing in the final analysis at 1 000 the xps 13 is a good value in a market that is rapidly becoming as commoditized as the rest of the laptop space but where fairly hefty prices still rule wired lovely design with great portability and a carbon fiber undercarriage solid performance numbers compared to the competition better keyboard than most ultrabooks tired touchpad performs well as long as you don t have to click on anything light on ports and no sd card slot rather loud fan but it only kicks in under heavy load wouldn t mind a resolution upgrade '),(298,'2009-11-11 00:00:00',7.0,53,' slide 2 slide 3 slide 4 slide 5 slide 6 slide 7 slide 8 slide 9 slide 10 slide 11 previous next cnet editors rating 3.5

got the tech world and gadget enthusiasts excited about palm once again long considered dead in the water palm s innovative webos operating system buoyed it back into the spotlight and the pre was certainly a boon for the company as well as sprint while not a complete savior the two are hoping to create some more magic with the new palm pixi a smaller cheaper version of the pre the pixi is aimed at a younger audience and to those who put a precedent on messaging or are making the jump from a feature phone to a smartphone you can think of the pixi as the replacement to the palm centro since it is a more entry-level smartphone you sacrifice some features such as wi-fi and a better camera in addition the pixi feels underpowered compared with the pre however what you do get is an incredibly sleek smartphone with an improved keyboard and enhanced contact management and messaging features plus you still get 3g support bluetooth gps and the great multitasking abilities of webos for first-time smartphone buyers and casual users the palm pixi is enough but power users and tech enthusiasts should go with the pre the pixi goes on sale november 15 as a sprint exclusive for 99.99 with a two-year contract it requires one of the carrier s unlimited data plans such as simply everything or everything data and after a 100 mail-in rebate the price is ok and sprint offers some of the better-valued voice and data plans that said to make the pixi a real enticing package it d be great to see sprint shave off even 10 on the price considering that the pre is only 50 more and you can get the htc droid eris from verizon for the same price with wi-fi design while the pixi name won t appeal to some people read men we can certainly see where the inspiration comes from as the smartphone is downright petite and dare we say cute the pixi is palm s thinnest device to date and measures a slight 4.37 inches by 2.17 inches wide by 0.43 inch thick and weighs 3.26 ounces it easily slips into a pants pocket and is incredibly light in the hand without feeling fragile the back of the phone has a nice soft-touch finish so it doesn t feel as plasticky or slick as the pre plus it has a more solid construction without any moving parts that come with a slider design the palm pixi is incredibly thin and compact while the name doesn t impress the phone s design certainly does of course with the compact size and slate form factor there are some trade-offs most notably screen size the palm pixi features a 2.63-inch capacitive touch screen with a 320x400 resolution so it s a bit of adjustment coming from the pre s 3.1-inch 320x480 hvga display particularly when viewing web pages and videos the app panels can also feel a bit cramped when you ve got the quick-launch bar or an e-mail preview occupying the bottom of the screen that said the screen is still bright and sharp we used multiple applications including apps previously downloaded from the app catalog for the pre such as yelp tweed and pandora and all played well with the screen s resolution the capacitive touch screen is responsive though the screen transitions aren t always swift or smooth see performance for more like the pre the pixi has multitouch capabilities so you can use the pinch gesture to zoom in and out of web pages photos and maps in addition there s a built-in accelerometer as well as a proximity sensor so the display will automatically turn off when you re on a call in order to prevent any accidental mispresses when holding the phone up to your ear below the display is a gesture area that s not visible to the naked eye however once you touch it you ll see a single line in the center light up this replaces the physical center button found the pre and when touched it brings you back to the deck of card view if you re working in an application swiping your finger right to left will also return you to the previous screen and dragging your finger from the gesture area up to the screen will bring up the launcher bar just like the pre for more information about the gestures as well as the pixi s user interface setup process and multitasking abilities please read our full review of the palm pre while having smaller buttons the pixi s qwerty keyboard was much easier to use than the pre s pressing on get it to the pixi s qwerty keyboard it is still small and in fact the buttons are narrower than the ones on the pre but it s way more comfortable and easier to use how could that be well for one thing the keys are raised higher and you don t have to deal with maneuvering around the edges of the phone caused by the slider design or having your thumb bump up against the bottom of the screen also the pixi s buttons provide more of a clicky feedback and don t feel as sticky or gummy to press so it s a much a better experience there will certainly be some adjustment since the keys are small but we found typing on the pixi to be much more comfortable than the pre and made less mistakes an official virtual keyboard by palm however has yet to be seen rounding out the palm pixi s design features is a power button and a 3.5mm headphone jack on top while the silent ringer switch volume rocker and micro-usb port are on the right side the latter is protected by the attached cover and while a little tricky to pry open it s much less cumbersome than the one found on the pre as usual the camera and flash are located on the back the palm pixi comes packaged with an ac adapter a micro-usb cable and reference material a touchstone kit will also be available for the pixi for 79.99 which includes the dock and inductive back cover in addition you can spruce up your pixi with one of six limited-edition back covers from the palm pixi artist series the designs by michelle white jeremy fish and cole gerst will be available at launch while those by sheri bodell and melissa hutton will ship in early december each cover costs 49.99 and work with the touchstone dock for more add ons please check our cell phone accessories ringtones and help page features as we mentioned earlier the palm pixi is meant to be more of an entry-level device so it doesn t have all the capabilities of the pre the biggest difference is that the pixi lacks wi-fi and also gets a lesser 2-megapixel camera which we ll talk about later in this section however the pixi still offers plenty for the first-time smartphone buyer and even includes some functionality not found on the pre yet at launch the palm pixi will actually ship with palm webos 1.2.9 out of the box but an over-the-air update to 1.3.1 should be available to most customers on the pixi s november 15 release date however palm sends out its updates in batches so there may be some who won t get theirs right off the bat but the company has said 1.3.1 will be available to customers within that week for any curious pre owners palm has not announced an official release date for webos 1.3.1 for your device but we suspect it won t be much later after the pixi s launch so what s new in webos 1.3.1 the most notable addition is the yahoo integration with palm s synergy feature this means that in addition to your outlook exchange activesync facebook google and linkedin information you can now incorporate your yahoo contacts calendar and messenger data into the pixi s address book like the other accounts you simply enter your e-mail address and password and synergy will do the rest merging any duplicate entries into one contact sheet just remember the more contacts you have the longer it will take the phone to get all the data so be patient once done an individual s contact page will show all his or her e-mail addresses phone numbers images if they re an instant-messaging buddy a dot next to their name will show their current status green for online orange for idle/busy or blank for offline while we absolutely love synergy for simplifying the contact management system we do wish there was a way to sync all your facebook contacts or just those who are already in your contacts database like on the motorola droid we were able to sync our yahoo account with the pixi but after initial setup we were asked several times to re-enter our password despite the fact that we got the message that synchronization was complete the first time we entered it despite this small oddity we received our yahoo mail as it arrived to our in-box and all contacts were integrated into the universal address book our yahoo im buddies transferred over to the unified messaging app though there s no distinction between the different im clients while we re on the subject of messaging there are some new enhancements first and foremost you can finally forward text messages you can do so by simply tapping on the message as well as copy a single message rather than an entire thread you can do both by simply tapping on the message which will bring up a menu with those options in addition there are new shortcuts in the e-mail app that allow you to flag messages mark as unread or move to a folder to find these options open a message and press the e-mail drop-down menu in the upper left-hand corner webos 1.3.1 also improves e-mail formatting when you forward or reply to messages continue to next page 1 2 editors top picks 1 htc one 4.0 stars 2 apple iphone 5 at amp t sprint verizon starting at 199.99 4.0

texters who hadn t considered a smartphone before by sascha segan it might seem natural to mock the palm pixi s name but it s actually brilliant this cute little smartphone isn t going up against high-end phones like the motorola droid and the iphone 3gs rather it could replace cheaper texting phones in the hands of slim-fingered people nationwide pc_magazine512 http ww.pcmag.com/article2/0 2817 2352875 00.asp design ui and voice calling if you think the pixi is too small it isn t for you its size is part of its point this is a phone for people with nimble fingers and sharp eyes yet who type a lot the pixi is a little black egg and at 4.4 by 2.2 by 0.4 inches hwd and 3.5 ounces it fits into small hands easily the phone s keys are small and slightly sticky but definitely manageable because palm got rid of the pre s annoying plastic lip around the keyboard view all 6 photos in gallery the pixi has the smallest capacitive touch-screen i ve ever seen on a phone at 2.63 inches and 320-by-400 pixels just like the keyboard it works perfectly well as long as you don t have sausage-fingers the pre s physical home button has been replaced by a virtual touch-sensitive button just below the screen the pixi s only real design flaw is that it s black while palm will sell 49.99 artist backs for the pixi the prime pixi consumer loves color where are the pink pixi the red pixi and the green-with-gold-sparkles pixi webos is just as much fun here as it is on the palm pre there s something about webos much more than android that just makes you smile while you re using it it s about the gestures webos is all flamboyant little flicks and twirls pinches and pulls shrinks and shuffles it s easy to learn and easy to love as long as you don t assume it works exactly like the iphone the pixi is a decent voice phone but it won t win any awards reception is pretty good the earpiece is of average volume and a little muddy ditto for the speakerphone there s some in-ear feedback of your own voice when you re talking which i find pleasant transmissions from the speakerphone sound pretty muddy the pixi works with wired 3.5mm headsets and automatically paired with our plantronics voyager pro bluetooth headset without a problem there s sadly no voice dialing battery life at 4 hours and 43 minutes of talk time was acceptable but a bit worrying you ll need to charge this phone daily messaging palm is pitching the pixi as a messaging phone and its messaging apps are convenient but still leave something to be desired the phone brings together contacts from facebook google linkedin yahoo and microsoft exchange in one phone book and merges google yahoo and exchange calendars into one calendar the pixi s e-mail client supports microsoft exchange push e-mail along with gmail google apps yahoo and pop/imap accounts it displays html e-mails beautifully though you may need to zoom in if you find the text too small built-in attachment viewers take care of even the most complicated picture microsoft office document and pdf attachments that s all pretty neat but palm s approach has gaps and competitors are catching up there s no support for facebook im or email unlike on the motorola cliq contact cards don t show facebook status messages unlike on the htc hero sms mms and im are bundled together into one cuddly app called messaging it s great-looking and easy to use but only supports aim yahoo and google talk no microsoft live messenger or any social network messaging systems the built-in facebook app is pathetic supporting only status updates and your news feed you can comment on your friends posts but you can t see their walls or do...well much of anything else it s a miserably spare facebook experience twitter and myspace are also left out you can download one of seven twitter clients but the pixi has absolutely zero app-level support for myspace that s disappointing for a phone at least somewhat aimed at teens web browsing and apps the pixi s primary problem is its scaled-down processor which meant sluggish responses especially when multitasking webos seems to be a spectacularly processor-heavy os even the palm pre which packs a state-of-the-art cortex a8 is no speed demon the pixi uses a qualcomm msm7627 which according to qualcomm has a 600 mhz arm11 application processor that s on par with android phones like the htc hero but with the super-heavy webos on board the msm7627 seems to stagger periodically the pixi connects to the internet using sprint s evdo rev a network there s no wi-fi here the pixi s web browser is excellent though this is an area where processor and screen size conspire to cramp your style pages loaded more slowly than on an htc hero or palm pre on the same network and the small screen required more zooming and more scrolling than on either of those other two phones it s a good thing the pixi supports pinch-to-zoom multitouch flash isn t supported but palm says that s coming soon other built-in apps include the usual memo pad a youtube browser sprint tv sprint navigation google maps and sprint s nascar and nfl apps google maps ran very slowly but eventually drew attractive maps and it offered accurate walking and transit directions sprint navigation had trouble finding our location because it required real gps as opposed to agps signal but it gave spoken driving directions compared to other smartphone platforms the pixi has a pathetic number of third-party apps about 359 at this writing and they re generally more basic and less powerful than you d see on the iphone this wouldn t be a problem if the pixi had the apps it needed for its target market myspace other social networks pixelpipe s generic uploader app while helpful doesn t quite cut it and lots of fun camera-effects apps for instance but the palm app catalog still just looks like thin gruel media the pixi is a mediocre media phone there s 8gb of built-in storage for your media but no media card slot it syncs music and video with itunes versions up to 9.0.1 if you ve accidentally upgraded to 9.0.2 you ll have to sync it with windows media player or a third-party program like doubletwist or salling media sync the phone plays mp3 and aac music tracks but not wma or ogg music sounds fine over wired or bluetooth headphones so far so good one noticeable problem is the pixi s underpowered processor has trouble multitasking music with other applications launching another app or starting to load a web page would cause the music to skip streaming music from pandora while reading e-mail didn t cause any skipping but the e-mail program ran pretty sluggishly the pixi s petite processor also has trouble with video mpeg4-format videos at 320-by-240 played decently but anything at higher resolution got jerky lip sync drifted pretty badly on a bluetooth stereo headset the built-in 2-megapixel camera takes photos so soft they re almost impressionist but at least it handled a low-light situation without blurring and it has relatively little shutter delay there s no video recording conclusions obviously the pixi is cramped and underpowered compared to sprint smartphones like the pre with its larger screen and the htc hero with 12 000 apps to the pixi s 359 the real competition here is against phones like the free sanyo scp-2700 or the 49.99 samsung reclaim or against older entry-level smartphones like the blackberry pearl or palm centro i m abusing the pixi a bit in this review but compared to those simpler phones it s far more powerful and way more fun web browsing on the centro and pearl is awkward i complain about the pixi s facebook app but the reclaim and scp-2700 don t have facebook apps at all the pixi raises the bar the same way the centro and pearl did when they first came out saying that you don t need to be a smartphone buyer to use a little bit of smarts in your phone it s 99.99 with a two-year contract right now but i suspect it ll get cheaper with time it s a good buy for folks with smaller hands who have never had a smartphone before benchmark test results continuous talk time 4 hours 43 minutes compare the palm pixi with several other mobile

chromebook pixel hands-on photos previous next view full gallery previous next jdocument.readyfunction j gallery3790163 .gallery the pixel is the best-designed laptop i ve ever used it s not the flashiest or the most noticeable necessarily when it s closed and off the matte gray lid certainly won t catch your eye next to the glowing apple logo on a macbook air but the pixel s smooth anodized aluminum body and slightly boxy look give the pixel a refined handsome business-y vibe this is the george clooney of laptops it s a bit heavier than the macbook air 3.35 pounds vs about three flat but everyone who asked to use the pixel said something about it being noticeably heavier i chalk that up to the pixel s lack of a wedge design the .65-inch-thick device looks much larger than the air which tapers down into near-nothingness but despite its relative largesse i d rather use the pixel its slightly rounded edges don t dig into my wrists like the air s and i like typing on a flat surface rather than the air s uphill slope during my review i used the pixel on an overnight flight from new york city to barcelona i used it for several hours on the dark plane and nearly every single person walking by my aisle looked at the pixel as they passed one guy even did a double-take screeching to a halt in the aisle as if he d seen a ghost in seat 17g they were all reacting to the pixel s lightbar which as far as i ve discerned exists only to look cool and futuristic and maybe a little menacing the device s product page corrobrates this idea if it does have a true purpose i don t care i just love watching the blue light glow every few seconds a bright spot travels from left to right and when you close the lid it briefly glows the rainbow of google colors also try the konami code on the keyboard and see what happens it s cool all the time but especially when the blue strip lights up dark rooms i m pretty sure i looked like daniel craig in a cerebral spy thriller hunched over my laptop deciphering codes and saving the world as the blue light crosses the pixel s lid it belongs in a spy movie or an episode of homeland the moment the laptop glows google s rainbow is the only indication you ever get that google made this machine there s a chrome logo above the keyboard but the word google never appears anywhere on the pixel i d like to chalk that up to internal politicking or self-hatred at google but it s really more a testament to the incredibly spartan existence of the chromebook pixel there are no stickers only the smallest set of fine print on the bottom and nothing but the essentials anywhere on this machine you get an sd card reader on the right side next to the sim card slot if you spring an extra 150 for the connected model on the left sit two usb 2.0 ports not the faster 3.0 unfortunately a minidisplay port a 3.5mm headphone jack and the hole for the ac adapter brick that plus trackpad keyboard hd webcam and display make up everything there is to see on the pixel i barely noticed the keyboard and trackpad which is about the highest compliment i can pay them i m used to the macbook air which i firmly believe has the best keyboard and the best trackpad of any device on the market that s most of the reason the macbook air was our favorite windows ultrabook too using the pixel felt identical the smooth glassy trackpad is fast and responsive though it s missing some of the gestures i love about os x and is really limited to pointing and scrolling plus the rare pinch-to-zoom gesture likewise the chiclet-style backlit keyboard clacks and travels just right is well-spaced and even uses a cool font on the keys there are a few chrome os-specific tweaks like the swapping of a caps lock button for a dedicated search key and a row of function buttons above the keyboard that let you change brightness switch between windows reload a page and the like those keys are are a little stiff to press and awkward to find but they re really handy i wish i had dedicated reload page and search google buttons all the time here s looking at you here s looking at you i ve never seen a better laptop screen let s say the pixel had a league-average 1366 x 768 display like the macbook air s maybe a little washed-out but viewing angles are solid and the screen does its job fine i d still like the pixel more than most laptops because the hardware is so good but i get to have my cake and eat it too because the pixel s screen is the best laptop display i ve ever seen its only rival is the retina macbook pro and it really doesn t matter which is better the upshot is this 2560 x 1700 display is astonishingly sharp bright accurate and vivid when i lie on my bed with my macbook air on my chest watching a movie or reading i can make out individual pixels pretty easily even with my eyes three inches away from the pixel s screen text still looks perfect i constantly complain about 16 9 tablets they re too wide and not tall enough or awkwardly tall when you hold the device vertically laptops don t have the latter problem why would you be holding your laptop sideways and i ve been sort of stockholm syndrome-d into dealing with a lack of vertical space but the pixel s 3 2 display which is nearly as tall as it is wide makes me wonder why no one else has thought to do this the 12.85-inch display isn t quite as wide as a standard 13-inch screen and you do get some letterboxing above and below any movie you re watching but the tradeoff is simply more vertical space to read a web page the unusual aspect ratio was probably an easier decision for google to make because web pages comprise the entire operating system but i wish every laptop offered a 3 2 screen that won t happen of course which is only more fodder for my wanting a pixel at various points i forgot the pixel s display was a touchscreen unlike with windows 8 machines where i constantly reach toward the screen whether it responds or not i never found myself instinctively tapping on the pixel the touchscreen works relatively well when i try to use it though it does tend to scroll in fits and starts rather than glide smoothly underneath my finger but thanks to some combination of the excellent trackpad and my subconscious reticence to sully the gorgeous display with fingerprints i just used the pixel like it had no touchscreen google s taking steps to make chrome os more touch-friendly which might change that there s a cool photo editing app that i did use with my finger but for now the touchscreen feels more like future-proofing than anything else a new fighting weight a new fighting weight in the last six months or so there s been a race toward the bottom with chromebooks how low could the specs go before performance took a noticeable hit the answer apparently is really low even an arm-powered chromebook worked well like a chromebook that makes it odd that the pixel is easily the most powerful chromebook ever with a dual-core 1.8ghz intel core i5 processor 4gb of ram and intel s integrated hd 4000 graphics that s roughly equal to most windows ultrabooks in the pixel s price range though a few come with more powerful core i7 processors the pixel works well but then of course it does chrome os has always been the most stable version of chrome on the planet and the pixel is likewise fast and virtually crash-free it boots in less than ten seconds and resumes almost instantly it s a very fast stable powerful machine that never gets too loud or too hot but it s not noticeably better than any other chromebook and it doesn t fix the problems seemingly endemic to these devices like their odd inability to smoothly play local videos i tried to watch 50 / 50 on a plane solid surprisingly intense movie and the pixel stuttered hard for about five minutes even once it settled it jerked through the whole movie jittering and pausing every few minutes yes it s pushing a lot of pixels on that display but the pixel and its core i5 should have no trouble playing a movie oddly files stream from youtube or drive much better i m not one for conspiracy theories but let s just say google really wants you to use drive it pushes you there at every turn you only get 32 or 64gb of internal storage but you get 1tb of drive storage for three years if you buy a pixel of course no amount of space can help me when i m offline on a plane wanting to awkwardly cry during a joseph gordon-levitt movie i m willing to give up a lot to use a chromebook i know there are apps i can t use i know printing is going to be a mess of non-compatibility i know that being offline severely limits the usefulness of my computer in return all i ask is battery life there chromebooks have been hit-or-miss the arm-powered samsung model lasted just nearly seven hours on a charge but the acer c7 only made it four hours and change sadly the pixel is more akin to the c7 on the verge battery test which cycles through a series of popular websites and high-res images with brightness at 65 percent the pixel lasted 4 hours and 30 minutes on one hand this result is a little skewed since the pixel s screen is so bright you can often use it at lower levels but even stretching the battery as much as i could while still using the device normally i never got more than five hours of battery life that s just not very good and doesn t make sense given how many sacrifices google already asks you to make high-end specs feel like overkill in some places chrome os life inside a browser even the best web browser has its limitations sacrifices are really the name of the chrome os game but not quite in the way i expected i was pleasantly surprised to find that most apps i use work on the web or at least have equivalent apps that do between evernote simplenote wunderlist gmail google docs office 365 rdio and tweetdeck i quickly set up a pretty good approximation of my standard workflow google s built-in photo editor is even pretty good i do miss photoshop though and i have yet to find even a decent irc client that works on chrome os google s even done a pretty good job of disguising that chrome os is just a web browser especially with the latest updates aura added a taskbar of sorts and the most recent version brings better notifications and an awesome searchable app tray once i set up a few apps to open as separate windows rather than browser tabs i could have convinced you that it was a desktop os as long as i have an active and fast internet connection if i could have a chromebook pixel plus google fiber connectivity i d die a happy man it s not a desktop os though and it s missing some of the things i rely on on my pc some are crucial way too many of the apps i named above don t work offline and even those that do are stripped-down slow and often clumsy other issues are minor but annoying there s no easy way to switch between apps for instance you either alt-tab through your open windows in some order i don t totally understand or you use the trackpad to select the app you want i quickly and deeply missed expose on os x or windows far superior alt-tab setup there are lots of these little issues with chrome os like the fact that offline features can only be enabled for gmail google docs and the like for a single gmail account i can t be the only person with work and personal email accounts who might need to access both on a plane right on the other hand there are things about chrome os i hope apple and microsoft are paying attention to google docs ability to save things automatically and seamlessly even while offline the resizing tool that gives you a bunch of different places to quickly snap a window the super-simple file browser that offers deep and powerful search i even love that google calls it australian scrolling instead of natural scrolling though i turned that off as fast as humanly possible chrome os offers a simple intuitive ui that i really enjoy using and i bet i could teach my grandma to use a chromebook faster than any windows or os x machine but it s ultimately limited and there are just too many apps it can t run and too few things you can do outside of absolutely ideal situations that s why chromebooks are usually thought of as secondary machines for power users and though google s slowly shedding the reputation it s a long way from finished wrap-up compare it google chromebook pixel 7.5 verge score write review good stuff screen is incredible great keyboard and trackpad excellent design bad stuff average battery life chrome os is still severely limited price is a deal-breaker can i borrow 1 299 i love the chromebook pixel i can t remember the last time i so unequivocally enjoyed using a device its display keyboard trackpad and overall fit and finish are as good as any laptop i ve ever used and in some cases is my new standard-bearer for laptop reviews going forward battery life is a bummer but not a deal-breaker it s not terrible just not as good as i hoped and i actually sort of liked the limitations of having to use browser-based tools because it meant i could recreate my entire workspace on any device that runs chrome and yet when it came time to write this review edit and upload pictures and do real research i opened up my macbook air again i needed photoshop i needed evernote to work offline because i needed a tool that worked better than google docs s scratchpad tool which is handy just not particularly powerful i needed to easily jump back and forth between three windows at once i d rather use the chromebook pixel but i wind up having to use the macbook all the time that s the problem if you have 2 600 to spend on a computer buy a macbook air and a chromebook pixel and live the rest of your life a happy shopper knowing i m deeply jealous but for the rest of us even 1 299 is a lot to spend on a laptop and i don t know who of the rest of us i d recommend a pixel to if you want a secondary computer with long battery life get a 200 samsung chromebook it s a darn good second laptop if you want a high-end laptop get a macbook pro with retina display and enjoy most of the

laptops seem to be heading in two different directions on one end there s the samsung chromebook series 3 at the time of his writing it s the best-selling laptop on amazon.com perhaps not surprising given its 249 price tag -- it s basically filling the low-end gap left by the collapse of the netbook and the rise of the 7-inch tablet at the other end of the spectrum is google s new chromebook pixel this is the first google-designed laptop -- not one that was farmed out to a partner like acer or samsung and google has upped the ante adding a high-res touch-screen -- with a pixel density greater than that of apple s vaunted retina screens -- and a real intel core i5 processor but the 3.3-pound pixel also has a high-end sticker price it starts at a whopping 1 299 that goes to 1 449 for the step-up model which adds a built-in 4g lte cellular modem and won t ship until early april of 2013 for die-hard denizens of the cloud this may look to be the ultimate online-only laptop but like its less-expensive predecessors the chromebook pixel comes with a long list of caveats -- all of which are amplified by its high price the screen is gorgeous but -- unlike windows 8 which has been designed to interact well with touch -- the chrome os itself is not particularly touch-friendly right now and unlike every other laptop in this price range the chromebook pixel can t run familiar desktop software like microsoft office or adobe photoshop -- only the chrome-compatible web-based alternatives such as google docs and pixlr express want to do video editing even if you think wevideo is as good as final cut or adobe premiere be prepared for long upload and download times as you manipulate your video clips in the cloud until google can provide a web app ecosystem that s as robust as the vast software libraries for mac and windows and a cloud-based architecture that s as convenient as working on your local hard drive this sort of high-end chromebook is going to remain a tough sell we like to think of the chromebook as a google experiment -- a physical playground upon which a handful of wealthy consumers play out a utopian google fiber future that anticipates gigabit wireless everywhere when that future arrives the chromebook pixel may be just the hardware to navigate it battery testing for this product is ongoing we ll update this review with those results once they are available and adjust the rating if necessary the screen the marquee feature of the chromebook pixel is its multitouch-enabled screen with enough pixels to match apple s retina display in person it s nothing less than spectacular the 12.85-inch 2 560x1 700-pixel display has a taller-than-usual 3 2 aspect ratio and is covered with a layer of gorilla glass for protection it also gives you an unusually high 400-nit brightness credit josh miller/cnet there s no doubt that the 3 2 ratio as opposed to the more common 16 9 ratio is a difference that becomes apparent in two ways the first is with the touch screen s height if you re typing away and then move to tap the screen it feels just a hair further away than the shorter wider windows touch screens that s not a bad thing necessarily but it is noticeable the second difference with the 3 2 ratio is that you get more vertical space in that regard it s a throwback of sorts to the older squarer 4 3 screens of the pre-hdtv era if all you use your laptop for is watching movies you may lament the return to larger black letterbox bars but chromebooks live in the cloud which means the web and in terms of design the web is nothing if not vertically-oriented you scroll down through your online docs or to read stories blogs and reviews such as this one it s a natural fit for something so centered on the web the screen density of 239 pixels per inch means it edges past the 13-inch macbook pro s retina display at 227ppi making fonts smooth and graphics sharp as with retina devices though a lot of software and web pages must be updated before graphics will look their best but text is a pleasure and going back to ordinary resolution displays is no fun using the touch screen itself was a smooth experience you ll encounter more problems from using chrome which does not have a touch-friendly interface than you will from anything related to the pixel s screen for example chrome s tabs are thin and it may take two or three taps to switch to the right one using the screen to draw or pinch-to-zoom was flawless screen resolution improves dramatically as this close-up view comparing a samsung chromebook s5 550 and the chromebook pixel shows credit stephen shankland/cnet hardware features under the hood inside the chromebook pixel is a dual-core 1.8ghz intel core i5 processor integrated intel hd 4000 graphics and 4gb of memory that s a huge step-up for chromebook power previous models use low-end celeron or arm chips essentially it puts the pixel at the same computing parity as other mac and windows pcs there are two versions of the pixel the 1 299 wi-fi-only model has a 32gb ssd flash storage while the 1 449 64gb model adds built-in 4g lte wireless both come with an impressive 1tb of cloud storage with google drive for three years while lte costs have not been fully revealed if you go over the google-comped 100mb per month you can add the pixel to your verizon share everything plan for 10 per month per day access is available as well although the price has yet to be revealed the left side of the pixel has the mini display port usb and headphone/microphone jacks credit josh miller/cnet on the outside the chromebook pixel has two usb 2.0 ports a mini displayport for external monitors an sd card slot and a combination headphone-microphone jack google promises five hours of battery life with typical usage bluetooth 3.0 and usb 2.0 mean that the pixel is a version behind the latest standards likewise you can get a mini displayport-to-hdmi adapter but nearly all other laptops in this price range with the notable exception of non-retina macbooks offer built-in hdmi even the 250 samsung chromebook series 3 comes with one usb 3.0 port continue to next page 1 2 editors

chrome os the google chromebook pixel is a unique laptop add to that a premium price starting at 1 299 and you can see why the pixel is in techcrunch s words the most brilliant laptop you ll never buy while lauding the chromebook s design and display most critics concur with engadget which points out that it s a piece of gorgeous hardware providing limited functionality at a price that eclipses the often more powerful competition techcrunch says that despite the 1tb of google drive storage that comes bundled with the pixel unless you do all of your work in the cloud this is going to be a hard expense to justify yes you can hack it to run linux and over a three-year period the google drive space ends up covering the cost of the laptop if you actually need 1tb of cloud storage and were going to pay retail for it that is in the end however the pixel is as engadget puts it a lovely thing that everyone should try to experience but sadly few should seriously consider buying

blocky like like a reference model from the mid 2000s only 64gb of local storage no usb 3.0 ports internet access is not ubiquitous and cheap yet loud fan noise bottom line the google chromebook pixel 64gb lte is a luxury laptop that needs internet access to work at its best if you already use a pricey mutli-gb verizon 4g lte data plan and have ready access to power the chromebook pixel makes sense however it s got some first generation hiccups to iron out before many more convert to chrome os all the time by joel santo domingo google is a company that will never let you forget that it s built upon experimentation in that regard the company has released the google chromebook pixel 64gb lte to a world of believers and doubters in a nutshell the chrombook pixel is essentially a thin client notebook with a brilliant screen like all thin clients it works well when connected to the internet where it can take advantage of the massive infrastructure that google has built up over the past fifteen years away from the internet the chromebook pixel is somewhat diminished take it at face value as a halo product for a category that google wants to flesh out over the next few years and you ll be okay in early 2013 the chromebook pixel is a luxurious experiment that shows potential but is definitely first-generation hardware that is dependent on omnipresent internet access compare

span.checkbox .clickfunction design and display the chromebook pixel feels as solidly built as a bank vault door it measures about 0.64 by 12 by 9 inches hwd and weighs about 3.36 pounds so it s squarely in the ultraportable and ultrabook chassis category the dark-silver-colored anodized aluminum case is sharply rectangular evoking the image of high-end laptops from the early-mid 2000s rather than the tapered and rounded shapes you see today if you were presented this in a design meeting you d think of it as squarely retro with no visible screws and that vaunted piano hinge with the chrome name etched in a sans serif font on it those 3.36 pounds make the chromebook pixel feel heavy for its size even though it is balanced well this gives you that solid feeling of quality that steve jobs used to crow about when talking about the first all-metal apple powerbooks in the early 2000s view all 8 photos in gallery the 12.85-inch ips in-plane switching screen is the thing that gives the chromebook pixel its name it has a 3 2 aspect ratio which a throwback to the mid-2000s when everything wasn t 16 9 widescreen yet a 3 2 aspect ratio is taller overall compared widescreen a 16 9 widescreen which makes the chromebook pixel well suited to the web apps that it is designed to run the screen resolution is 2 560 by 1 700 at 239 pixels per inch ppi which is imperceptibly denser than the 220 ppi on the apple macbook pro 15-inch retina display and the 227 ppi on the apple macbook pro 13-inch retina display on all three screens video and photos look amazing with the ability to zoom in and view multi megapixel images clearly without any distortion or blockiness streaming videos from hbo go max go amazon instant video and netflix looked spectacular on the pixel s display as did the pre-loaded demo video hbo go in particular looked like a movie theater screen when viewed at a two-foot distance older sd videos were a little blockier but still looked nice on the pixel s screen the screen has a wide viewing angle so you can share videos with a few close friends touch-screen functionality the chromebook pixel comes with a backlit chiclet style keyboard which was moderately comfortable to use the keys are a bit slick but the key feel was similar to other keyboards like the one on the macbook pros the hp spectre xt touchsmart ultrabook 15-4010nr and the editors choice for high-end ultrabooks the asus zenbook prime touch ux31a-bhi5t the chromebook pixel s multi-touch glass trackpad is very responsive so much so that you re likely to use that instead of the system s built-in touch screen the touch screen is responsive but the system doesn t come with pinch-to-zoom active by default you have to go into some hidden settings google them to enable pinch-to-zoom in the chrome environment there s also the fact that the google chrome os interface uses traditional ui elements like the launch bar at the bottom of the screen and menu bars at the top of browser windows so for most users the trackpad is the way to go speaking of the chrome browser chrome is really the main interface for using this laptop we ve seen it before on chrome os systems like the samsung chromebook series 3 xe303c12 and acer c7 chromebook c710-2847 after you log into any chromebook it brings you a screen where the options are to launch the chrome browser or web apps that run in the chrome browser it s really useful if you have bought into google s suite of services gmail google docs google drive google maps etc. if you want to run web apps in chrome there s a link to the chrome web store with thousands of games and apps that work fine or at least as well or better than those on windows rt android and ios devices all of these apps and websites load very quickly and run well on the system s intel core i5-3427u processor with intel hd graphics 4000 wake and boot times were measured in seconds and web apps loaded just as quickly on our corporate internet connection one plus for the chrome os model is that it is self-updating as long as google stays on the game it will be a very secure haven against malware and viruses chrome os won t be affected by the majority of windows or mac os malware though you will still have to guard against identity theft and phishing attacks since you re mainly working in the cloud with google drive your documents emails and other work are saved automatically and are accessible from other pcs and macs basically the chromebook pixel is a thin client and while thin clients work great in corporate environments where network access is assured network access cannot be guaranteed for consumer products the real issue is that at this point in time internet access outside of the home or work doesn t support a product like this wwan whether tethered using the built in 4g lte modem or on a mobile hotspot is still too expensive to use all the time wi-fi on trains planes and automobiles is spotty at best those who live where satellite internet is the norm or in counties where the internet runs at dsl speeds are likely to have a poor experience with cloud computing early adopter users will forgive spotty internet access in a 200 laptop on a 1 450 laptop not so much fast and hot most of the time the system is quiet but when there is a lot of processing happening in the web browser like when playing back videos or when you re loading multiple tabs with lots of flash or html5 the fans make themselves heard essentially the fans will spool up on the same sorts of sites that spin up the fans on your pc or mac laptop the problem is that on a mac or pc you can switch to local apps that let the processor cool and let the fans spool down on the chromebook pixel you re using flash and html5 all the time thus active web apps and rich websites will make the fan run loud more often when the system is working hard the keyboard deck near the esc key starts to get quite warm it s not an area that most touch typists rest fingers on but it s worth noting speakers other noise concerns involve the internal speakers they re mounted under the keyboard so that there aren t any unsightly external openings but that also means that the keys reverberate when you listen to videos and music at high volume levels playing test tracks like the knife s silent shout and daft punk s tron legacy soundtrack made the keyboard buzz with the beat at high volume levels on the one hand the chromebook pixel pumps out enough sound that you won t need external speakers on the other they re not good sounds when the volume is turned up all the way audio using the headset jack was fine connectivity we looked at the lte-equipped chromebook pixel which is a good model for connectivity the chromebook pixel comes with two usb 2.0 ports for connecting modems mice and more it s a shame that the ports aren t usb 3.0 which would be faster for local storage on usb sticks and hard drives the core i5 processor in the chromebook pixel will certainly interface fine with usb 3.0 there s also a sd card slot for additional storage and a mini-displayport for external monitors the built-in 4g lte wwan module on our configuration works on verizon s network and comes with 100mb per month free like other chromebooks with wwan however you re going to burn through that in a short session so consider upgrading to one of verizon s larger data plans if you want to use the chromebook pixel away from home the office or coffee shop hotspots because of the limited data plan you ll likely use the system primarily on wi-fi and it can connect via both 2.4ghz and 5ghz 802.11a/b/g/n bluetooth 3.0 is included so you can tether to your phone if you have service for that google includes 12 free sessions on gogo inflight internet but make sure you re on short flights or reserve a seat with a power plug the chromebook pixel with its 59 whr battery only lasted 4 hour 11 minutes on our rundown test this is several hours less than systems like the macbook pro 13-inch 74whr 7 10 battery life and the asus zenbook prime touch ux31a 50 whr 6 38 battery life you ll need to keep the chromebook pixel near a power plug if you want to continuously use it all day storage the chromebook pixel comes with 64gb of storage which seems small compared with the 128gb in the macbook pro 13-inch and other portables like the microsoft surface windows 8 pro but the chromebook pixel comes with 1tb of google drive service free for three years professionals and chrome users alike have pointed out that 1tb of google drive cloud storage service alone would cost 1 800 over three years and that you can use google drive on your other pcs and macs however there is a 10gb file size limit on google drive and it s less useful to you if you re away from stable internet service you can use the sd card reader or external usb drives to supplement the 64gb internal ssd we were able to copy an mp4 video file to the onboard storage and play it without a connection to the internet but other files like spreadsheets are read-only without google docs on an internet connection sure you can set up google docs to work offline but it s not set up that way by default and even if you set it up you can only edit word documents and presentations other documents like spreadsheets and drawings can t be edited offline a premium product like the chromebook pixel really should be set up to use all of the basic functions like gmail google docs and google drive offline by default that initial setup should automatically be part of the extra services you re paying for you ll also need to manually download and install your chrome browser apps that are capable of being used offline we realize that most of the time you will be connected to wi-fi or wwan but if you regularly find yourself travelling where your internet access is spotty or slow like on a safari plane train ship or automobile then you better have a backup like a 4g portable hotspot tethered phone or satellite internet device so with all that what s the verdict the chromebook pixel 64gb lte is appealing in the same way that 150 chopsticks made of carbon fiber are appealing yes they will do all the things that chopsticks are expected do like lift sushi off of a plate and they have the luster and feel of expensive material the question is why would you get one when 5 lacquered wood chopsticks will do the same thing for pocket change the problem is aside from the perceived status screen and the added extra services there really aren t a lot of reasons to recommend the chromebook pixel over say the 13-inch macbook pro with or without retina display or the asus zenbook prime touch ux31a-bhi5t if wireless internet were cheap fast unlimited everywhere and reliable then the chromebook pixel with its included google drive subscription would be a decent buy at 1 450 however since wireless internet is not cheap and everywhere and since the chromebook pixel s battery isn t all day capable we can t recommend it over any mac or windows-based laptop in its price range comparison table compare the google chromebook pixel 64gb lte with several other laptops side by side more laptop reviews hp

this point you already have an opinion on google s chromebooks the idea of living with a computer that runs only web apps some of which also work offline is a concept you re either ok with or not into at all you either get it or you don t for those who do get it google s chromebook pixel is an outstanding machine for those who can t embrace the idea of chrome os even at the low 250 price point of the samsung chromebook itself a fantastic machine well the 1 300 pixel will do absolutely nothing to convert you if anything it ll just piss you off it will elicit scoffs and huffs and grumbles about how google has no idea what it s doing building a high-priced laptop that only runs a web browser you can count me among the converts i m what you d call a cloud power user for the last couple of years nearly everything i do on a desktop or laptop computer takes place in the browser usually with a dozen or so tabs open as such everything i need to do for work i can do on a chromebook after using the pixel since its launch almost a week ago i feel like this computer was tailored to suit my current computing life i m enamored with the machine how could i not be the pixel is the most powerful and finely crafted chromebook ever built it s lust-worthy in its excess and there s nothing else quite like it on the market and if you opt for the 150 lte connectivity upgrade it becomes a laptop that s a hell of a lot of fun to take along with you almost anywhere brightcove.createexperiences is the pixel perfect not at all does it meet all of my needs almost but no but with its considerate design built-in 4g connectivity gobs of speed nice trackpad and intriguing high-density touchscreen the pixel is a device that is ahead of its time and something that s clearly been designed to far exceed the demands of the regular web user all previous chromebooks have been unapologetically utilitarian cheaply priced cheaply built and a bit crude they re the entry-level economy cars of laptops they re great secondary computers that i ve found myself using as primary machines due to their convenience but the pixel is different than all the rest it s like riding in a plush new high-performance luxury sports car if the samsung chromebook is a honda fit the pixel is a lamborghini gallardo while they live on two opposite ends of the chromebook spectrum they perform the same basic functions albeit with wildly different levels of style class and power photo by alex washburn/wired open the lid and the machine starts up automatically before you can even reach for the power button it s on in about four or five seconds your login screen pops up from there you see your desktop and you re ready to launch any web app or website everything is stupid-fast because chrome os is such a lightweight operating system there isn t much to it sure there s a desktop but you can t do anything with it other than change the wallpaper and pin app icons to the lower left-hand corner and nowhere else no matter which pixel you buy google throws in 1tb of free google drive storage for three years buying this much google drive storage would cost more than the most expensive pixel within the case are damn near the same guts you d find in a 13-inch macbook air which is priced about the same both use intel s core i5 cpu with integrated hd graphics 4000 processing both ship with 4gb of ram though apple does offer an optional upgrade to 8gb of ram for an extra 100 and both have non-user-replaceable batteries a minimum of ports and no optical drives the wi-fi-only version with 32gb of local storage runs 1 300 an upgraded version which connects to verizon s 4g lte network and offers 64gb of local storage sells for 1 450 no matter which pixel you buy google throws in 1tb of free google drive storage for three years buying this much google drive storage would cost more than the most expensive pixel 50 per month over three years is 1 800 it s so much space i suspect most pixel users won t even use the whole terabyte afforded them but no matter how you look at it the pixel isn t cheap it s priced like a premium laptop because it is one the quality quickly becomes apparent once you get to using it it s sturdy as hell i couldn t find a flex or a creak in my testing the body is made of durable smooth anodized aluminum this metallic skin serves as a comfortable palm rest as you re typing on the pixel s black chiclet keyboard which is one of the nicest keyboards i ve ever typed on an ambient light sensor activates keyboard backlighting as needed and below the keys is a black glass trackpad that is one of the most responsive and finger-friendly trackpads i ve ever used the trackpad captures a feel that s somewhere between glass and smooth rubber it s soft but not pliable and it s awesome photo by alex washburn/wired the pixel s body design is top-notch too it doesn t redefine the laptop in any way but it s a cleaner take on the rectangles we ve seen before the ports two usb 2.0 one mini-display port and a combo sd/mmc card reader are devoid of labels there s no google logo to be found either just the word chrome inlaid above the keyboard and etched into the back of the display s piano hinge the cut-out at the center of the laptop s lip below the trackpad allows you to get your thumb under the lid to lift it up when it s closed and it s also the same shape as an upside down tab from the chrome browser an led light strip on the pixel s lid lights up when you turn it on when you put it to sleep or when you type the konami code it serves no real purpose but it adds a bit of fun to an otherwise business-minded design the pixel fits right in with google glass the nexus 4 7 and 10 as yet another beautifully designed and well-built device that

truly innovative or wowing apart from the chipset the optimus g s design is pleasant and functional but uninspired its 8-megapixel camera is weaker than those of the top-tier competition and its battery life is insufficient given the demands of the phone s bright screen and performance sprint s optimus g version is arguably the better device thanks to its crisper 13-megapixel camera there s very little that s actually wrong with the device but even with its bulging processing muscle the optimus g won t sweep aside the samsung galaxy s3 or iphone 5 both of which received a higher raw score from us and an editors choice and we expect the upcoming htc one x and nokia lumia 920 to put on the pressure too design and build the lg optimus g which comes in black and white and has a familiar square slate design the corners are ever so slightly rounded and the left and right edges of the phone curve slightly outward while pleasant-looking and functional it certainly isn t pushing boundaries defining your personality or wowing you with standout machining in fact it reminds us of the unlocked samsung galaxy s ii standing 5.01 inches tall by 2.8 inches wide by 0.37 inch thick the optimus g is slightly wider and thinner than lg s international quad-core phone the optimus 4x hd which measures 5.19 inches by 2.69 inches by 0.38 inch its 5.44-ounce heft makes it solid but also on the heavy side still it s a smidge lighter than the 4x hd as well the lg optimus g sports a unique polarized gorilla glass backing credit josh miller/cnet like other jumbo phones the optimus g can t be squeezed into smaller pockets and this is not a device to use one-handed however tossing it into a bag or larger back pocket works just fine we were able to tote it around in a stretchy back pocket it didn t look very attractive protruding from the material but ambulation was possible lg calls its 4.7-inch optimus g s screen a true hd ips display that translates to a 1 280x768-pixel resolution wxga the optimus g s 15 9 aspect ratio is a little off the 16 9 standard but that hasn t bothered us so far pixel density comes in at 320ppi for reference the nokia lumia 920 has 332ppi the iphone 5 has 326ppi and the samsung galaxy s3 has a 306 pixel-per-inch density the absolute pixel density by the way only indicates clarity but suffice it to say that this beautiful screen did not disappoint giving bright and crisp edges and vivid appealing color there s more to know about the dominating screen as well lg boasts that its touch hybrid display technology makes the screen 30 percent slimmer because it removes the air gaps separating the cover glass from the touch layers -- and light source -- below lg isn t the only company to do this the iphone 5 and htc one x advertise a similar process in addition the use of corning s gorilla glass 2 on the front and back panels contributes to the weight but could also lend strength however we didn t want to smash the phone on concrete to test durability against cracks below the display are touch-sensitive buttons for back home and menu press and hold home to also open your list of recent apps do the same to the menu button to pull up a google search bar above the screen you ll find the 1.3-megapixel front-facing camera the volume rocker hangs out on the left spine along with a covered bay that holds the sim and microsd card slots the power button is on the right we not-so-secretly wish that a hardware camera button were here too but its absence doesn t earn the phone any black marks you ll charge the optimus g through a micro-usb charging port on the bottom of the phone and you ll connect your headset through the 3.5mm jack up top nestled into the polarized and patent-pending back panel are the 8-megapixel camera lens and led flash features and os the lg optimus g runs on the android 4.0.4 ice cream sandwich os although we d prefer to see android 4.1 jelly bean on this device we can t really fault lg for not being more current with ice cream sandwich the optimus g receives all of google s services like chrome car home gmail maps with navigation search and youtube the google play stores for books magazines movies amp tv and music are included as well at amp t also loaded some of its apps such as a code scanner a family member locator a storage cloud at amp t ready2go which lets users set up their phones through their computers a hot-spot manager its own brand of navigation and messaging a live tv portal with a weeklong trial and an app through which you can check your at amp t account and data balance other goodies include two file-sharing apps smartshare and fileshare amazon kindle facebook polaris office 4.0 mobile office suite twitter a video editor and the yellow pages and of course there are more basic apps such as a native browser and e-mail client music and movie players a clock with alarm functions an address book a notepad and voice command furthermore lg packed its flagship device with tons of interesting features some we ve seen before like the optimus 3.0 user interface we re internally divided over this ui on one hand lg has done a nice job of adding some functionality without imposing too much of its own personality on top of ice cream sandwich on the other hand it s not as sleek and elegant as google s vision of the os and certain widgets look dated however users can customize some app icons for completely new icon looks rest assured at any rate that the os doesn t get in the way of using the phone lg s signature note-taking app quickmemo comes packaged with optimus 3.0 with this app you can use your finger or a stylus to jot down quick notes and sketches directly over screen images which you can then save and share you can also customize the color and style of your pen tip like most recent higher-end lg phones the optimus g includes quickmemo credit lynn la/cnet another feature dual screen dual play lets you mirror screen images between the phone and another tv or monitor and what s displayed doesn t necessarily have to be the same content other extras include pinch-zooming during recorded video playback wise screen which keeps the screen on when it detects someone s face staring at it an aspect ratio corrector that corrects how downloaded apps display in case of screen distortion a battery saver that helps to conserve power and battery reserves lg motion gestures so users can control certain functions like pausing video or turning off an alarm through physical gestures and an eco mode module that optimizes the optimus g s quad-core performance the phone has the usual connections of wi-fi gps and bluetooth there s also nfc support but unfortunately the at amp t version won t include lg tag stickers which enable users to activate customizable phone settings with nfc the sprint model however will you ll be able to access system settings from the notifications pull-down and pinching and zooming on the

brightness and flash are other settings you can also select your favorite of four shutter sounds or turn it off for fancier shooting options you can turn on hdr high dynamic range mode or take a sweeping panorama shot there s also continuous-shot mode which takes a burst of six photos there are some other fun things you can do with the camera time catch shot for example takes a series of six shots around an event so you can choose the best single image to keep you can also set a voice trigger to take photos if you say one of five programmed words cheese smile whisky kimchi or lg just beware that you may snap unwanted shots when instructing people to say cheese video controls are similar but you do have a few different options the first is whether to record a long video or a short one for mms another feature qslide makes it possible to use other apps while a video is playing in the background the function is nestled in the video app and is denoted on the top right corner by an icon of two rectangles layered on top of each other when a video is playing you can tap this icon and a transparent app drawer will spring up though qslide isn t intuitive to find it s easy to use and

if anything it had a bit more gain in both directions its reception also matched the good quality of the q s both indoors and out in addition it s easy to hold for long periods due to its lightweight design and curved shape the centro sounded full and clear when paired with a cardo s-800 bluetooth headset and its speakerphone was louder than i expected given the handset s small size like the sprint version the palm centro on verizon is a dual-band cdma device 850/1900 mhz that also supports the carrier s high-speed ev-do data network that means checking e-mail browsing wap sites and downloading third-party software are all quicker than on the pokier at amp t version which lacks support for the carrier s 3g hsdpa network still expect speeds from 270 to about 550 kilobits per second considering the palm os s lower real-world bandwidth there s no wi-fi radio in this or any centro to date but given verizon s robust ev-do coverage that s less of a problem than it is on say at

only option and the lack of a bundled im client is ridiculous given this handset s consumer focus and full qwerty keyboard though its mms mode has a convenient chat-style view in case you haven t heard palm os 5.4.9 is getting pretty long in the tooth the os isn t multithreaded so forget about doing more than one task at a time except for a few things such as listening to an mp3 track in the background also the os doesn t support voice dialing over bluetooth--a real problem when driving there s no support for gps which isn t too terrible since there are no palm devices with gps radios on the bright side however the built-in version of google maps for mobile does look amazing multimedia capabilities are also very limited pocket tunes works well as a basic music player but you can t listen wirelessly over stereo bluetooth you can sideload media via the handset s microsd slot which works with cards up to 4gb there s no built-in video player grab a copy of the discontinued yet

records middling 352-by-288 video files a continuous-talk-time test drained the centro s 1150-mah battery in 4 hours 23 minutes palm has abandoned this operating system one reason why our reviews of recent palm os based devices have been less than stellar on the other hand the centro is selling well on sprint and at amp t and at 99 i have no doubt that this model will also be successful it s a capable first smartphone for anyone who wants to move beyond voice calls and texting the centro exemplifies the classic case of a company that figured out how to buy extra time using its existing aging product line but that s not a sustainable strategy in the long term palm os is actually losing capabilities for example its java license expired in january so you can t load in opera mini without an unsupported hack and third-party development is grinding to a halt as developers shift their energies toward platforms with a future it s a strange prospect to buy a device knowing its os will have no future support but as a two-year play starting now it s still a good buy if your needs are limited to voice calls reading wap sites e-mail and texting the centro will delight with its

registered when i dialed quickly you could hear audible distortion as the tone sounds piled up similar 2-second delays occurred when i switched between applications on the plus side i really liked the

first post-ericsson phone sony has already reached the end of the alphabet with its flagship for 2013 the xperia z the implication behind the name is that this handset is as ultimate as the letter z itself and sony s design and marketing teams have worked hard to amplify that idea cheap plastic has given way to tempered glass on the phone s back and the power button is a precisely machined aluminum disc so much time and attention has been poured into this one device that sony s ads are now boldly proclaiming it as innovative as the company s hallowed trinitron and walkman brands p gt one thing s for sure sony s not content with being an also-ran in the android smartphone race and the z is its boldest attempt to grab the lead yet it has all the requisite spec credentials a 1080p display quad-core processor lte but it s facing a market saturated with feature- and spec-rich devices that will demand something a little extra can sony stand out on design alone might the playstation mobile experience finally deliver or are we just staring down yet another overgrown android looking for a raison d tre let s find out p gt hardware hydrophilic hardware a glass sandwich built around a patty of highly integrated electronics xperia z review gallery previous next view full gallery previous next jdocument.readyfunction j gallery3849097 .gallery like the iphone 4 and the nexus 4 the xperia z has a glass panel covering its entire back which together with the buttonless front makes for a highly symmetrical look and feel the best tactile indication of which side of the phone you re holding is probably the side-mounted power button which protrudes from the middle of the right side has a satisfying amount of travel and is flanked by the phone s volume rocker and micro sim card slot there s some curvature to soften the edges but the xperia z is otherwise a diligent study in flat surfaces sony has clearly put an emphasis on not interrupting the all-glass aesthetic which has led to the earpiece being tucked right into the top of the handset with its opening being mirrored at the device s bottom for the microphone glass inserts can also be found on each side section of the z ensuring a consistent texture all around the phone the trouble is that although cohesive the feel of this phone in the hand isn t actually very good the biggest culprit is of course the 5-inch form factor it may well be impossible to design an ergonomically pleasing handset at that size but sony doesn t help matters with its ultra-angular design whereas nokia and htc might start their phone sketches by drawing the hand into which they must fit sony s design philosophy seems to prioritize the look over the feel you can submerge the entire phone in water without causing it any harmthough it makes few concessions to ergonomics the xperia z deserves credit for its thinness and minimal bezel you get the sense that every superfluous millimeter has been shaven off this phone so as to make its size more palatable additionally sony s endowed the xperia z with a quality that most other mobile manufacturers consider an extravagant extra water resistance you can submerge the entire phone in water without doing damage to its precious internals that necessitates flaps covering every port on the z including the headphone jack but on the balance it s a trade-off worth making in fact if you buy the additional charging dock and make use of sony s launch promotion of bundling the xperia z with a set of mdr-1 bluetooth headphones you might never need to open the phone s covers after slipping your sim card in adding to the z s ruggedness is a very rigid construction and all-around excellent build quality it survived a pair of meter-high drops during my review and doesn t convey the same sense of vulnerability that you might get when handling the aforementioned iphone 4 / 4s or nexus 4 making an all-glass device that s as durable as its plastic- or metal-shielded competitors is a design feat sony should be commended for there s a subtle ostentatiousness about the xperia z while its lines are clean and mostly spartan the high reflectivity from its glass surfaces and the vividness of its white and purple versions make it a difficult device to use discreetly it s also not easy to operate with just one hand but at least its power button is easily accessible and its dimensions are minimal for the screen size keep in mind that those measurements have been tightly packed with components so the z s weight is concomitantly greater as well you won t be mistaking it for the dainty xperia sx any time soon display pixel density isn t everything the xperia z is more attractive with its screen turned off rather than on n.b the lock screen above is displaying the time and date in its upper third but they re almost imperceptible due to the loss of contrast at oblique angles aside from overhauling its choice of materials sony has also stepped up big time in the display department with a new 1080p panel that s over 2 million pixels squeezed into a 5-inch footprint resulting in a spectacularly dense and detailed display try as i might i could never discern an individual pixel from those around it which is hardly surprising given that the 440ppi pixels per inch density of the z is roughly a third greater than the 326ppi of the iphone s retina display in fact with most 720p displays already achieving similar results you might say the full 1920 x 1080 resolution here is surplus to requirements all the same it feels good to know that any full hd movies you choose to watch on the z will receive a pixel-for-pixel reproduction on the phone s large display even if that s largely a psychological comfort rather than a practical advantage color accuracy and the automatic brightness adjustment are both well calibrated on the z however sony s latest flagship retains a weakness from its predecessors poor viewing angles tilting the phone away from you in any direction quickly washes out the picture neither the optical lamination of the screen nor the software enhancements of the mobile bravia engine 2 can prevent the loss of contrast and color fidelity when looking at the z from an indirect angle it s disappointing to have to keep harping on this issue with sony whose whole xperia line is characterized by the dichotomy of sophisticated design and inadequate lcds just once the company should splash out on a truly gorgeous display such as you will find in the upcoming htc one that the xperia z is going up against and see how much of a difference that makes as it stands today the xperia z is more attractive with its screen turned off rather than on audio and battery life beat-rocking block the droid dna this is not if verizon s htc handset has lowered your battery life expectations for 5-inch 1080p phones allow the xperia z to raise them back up again in regular use the new sony phone consistently lasts for a full day on its 2330mah battery that might include syncing gmail and social clients persistently listening to music occasional web browsing video playback and gaming though sony has an extra trick up its sleeve to improve endurance even further it s called stamina mode what sony does is as simple as it is effective all background apps and data transfers are disabled when the screen is turned off thereby eliminating the vampiric power draw of running processes you don t need while the phone idles you still receive phone calls and messages as usual plus you can whitelist apps that you don t want affected by stamina mode meaning that after a bit of tailoring you can run this as your phone s default setting sony claims that enabling stamina mode can quadruple the xperia z s standby time and my experience with the phone confirmed this feature is no gimmick leaving the phone to mostly idle for one day i found it barely consumed 15 percent of its charge and even that power consumption was primarily down to the few occasions when i turned it on and used it stamina mode will do little to help power users or avid mobile photographers but for the vast majority of people with whom the phone spends most of its time inactive it can have a definite positive impact stamina mode ain t no joke brotherreviewing the xperia z in the uk i wasn t able to test its lte performance whether in terms of reception or its effect on battery life when it comes to 3g connectivity and voice calls however this phone acquits itself very well swapping the same sim card between the xperia z and xperia t sony s newer phone is better at establishing and maintaining a clear connection with massively improved voice quality to boot in low-reception areas where the iphone 5 would drop calls and the xperia t would generate a tinny echo-filled call the xperia z is able to carry on an almost faultless conversation mobile data performance is similarly reliable with my experience being corroborated by some strong speedtest results and a consistently-filled signal bar sony goes for minimalism with its xperia z packaging and accessories bundling only a micro usb cable a charger and a headset in the box but what a headset it is the sexily-titled mh-ex300ap delivers a tight thoroughly satisfying bass response that s ideally suited to modern music tastes though the treble can grow harsh at times the sound quality on offer here is still markedly better than the afterthought buds you d usually find taking up space in a smartphone s box volume controls alongside the in-line mic would have been nice to have as well but the bigger problem for the xperia z is its loudspeaker probably compelled by the desire for a water-resistant design sony has opted to side-mount the speaker at the bottom right of the phone which makes it very easy to mute by holding the device in your right palm even when not physically obstructed the speaker sounds muffled and its mediocrity stands in stark contrast to the headset which you d be well advised to use for all your musical needs sony s tradition of bundling high-quality headsets with its phones continues camera more pixels than sense this is not the cameraphone you re looking for xperia z camera sample photos previous next view full gallery previous next jdocument.readyfunction j gallery3849151 .gallery at its ces launch earlier this year sony made a big deal of the xperia z s new 13-megapixel exmor rs sensor but it needn t have it s a letdown while the sensor itself may be an improvement on previous generations sony s software and post-processing are simply not good enough the camera app can be accessed directly from the lock screen but takes a comparatively long time to get going it s no match for the lightning-quick operation you d get from htc and samsung s best phones and even the xperia t gets you to a state of readiness quicker thanks to its retention of a dedicated camera key that offers a quick launch function once inside the app you re provided a pleasingly barebones interface with a couple of quick shortcuts and the ability to record video or pictures without switching modes as well as simultaneously nothing here is unique to sony though the company does handle a couple of things differently one is the autofocus which only activates after you press the shutter button you can set the area of focus in advance but you won t know whether the camera achieves focus or how it ll expose the image until you instruct it to shoot that s unnecessarily unwieldy and speaking of exposure the xperia z seems to fluctuate between a sharp contrasty mode and a softer less processed look the wide chasm between the two will have photography enthusiasts grinding their teeth in displeasure clearly the xperia z has its struggles metering the surrounding light and its choices for what to do depending on that light also appear severely limited most images shot with the xperia z exhibit the unfortunately familiar one-two punch of graininess and blurriness the former arising from the basic process of turning photons into digital information and the latter being applied by sony to try and obscure that damage just to top off the over-processed appearance sony also throws in some extra sharpening to clean up some of its own noise-reducing blur the end result are 13-megapixel photos that you d never care to use at 13 megapixels but they are decent at a more conventional resolution like 5 megapixels it might have been preferable to just build a better 5-megapixel camera however video recording is also not without its flaws image stabilization helps when the camera s stationary but it makes pans jittery having to choose between shot stability and framing flexibility isn t ideal on the plus side audio recording is excellently detailed the autofocus shifts quickly between near and distant subjects and the auto-exposure is usually reliable and adjusts swiftly just because you call it hdr video doesn t mean it is hdr videosony also provides an optional hdr high dynamic range mode for both photos and video however its effect can be described as negligible at best hdr is intended as a method to enhance contrast by analyzing and combining multiple exposures of the same image and indeed its appearance in video recording on the xperia z is the first time we ve seen it enabled in motion capture but its implementation simply isn t very good you ll struggle to find any advantage to enabling hdr and worse motion blur may become an issue as the camera takes longer to expose the image multiple times software fighting a soft war sony s sullying one of its most beloved brands with the atrocity that is playstation mobile staying mostly faithful to the underlying android interface sony s cosmic flow skin is one of the more restrained and thereby least offensive oem customizations of google s mobile os the android navigation keys are all done in software google now is accessed with the standard swipe up from the home button and the multitasking overview is almost identical to the stock option sony just enhances it with an added set of quick links to small apps like a note taker and a calculator while the notification tray up top is similarly augmented with a set of toggles for muting the phone or turning wireless communications on and off the choice of themes and widgets hasn t changed from what sony already offers on the xperia s and xperia t leaving the lock screen to undergo the biggest makeover there s a new unlocking animation simulating window blinds and a pair of shortcuts taking you directly to the camera or media controls it s no longer as versatile however as the xperia t s ability to swipe directly into a text message or missed call from the lock screen notification has been removed sony s unique proposition on the software front is three-pronged music unlimited video unlimited and playstation mobile the subscription-based music service is just one of a litany of options open to android users at this point and the same is true of the rent-or-buy video store neither offers a standout reason to be used ahead of better-stocked alternatives from amazon and google most regrettably psm joins them in being a faint shadow of what one might expect from the service s name alone the launch of the xperia play two years ago was supposed to herald the arrival of a brave new era of retro mobile gaming all our favorite ps one titles were eventually going to join this new playstation mobile movement and we d all be doing that tactical espionage thing on our xperia handsets alas the playstation store didn t go live on mobile devices until recently and is presently populated by a random selection of disposable games the playstation phone promise remains heartbreakingly unfulfilled performance featuring a fancy new 1.5ghz quad-core snapdragon chip you d expect the xperia z to breeze through anything and everything thrown at it that s mostly the case there s no app that unduly slows down this phone however you ll be hard-pressed to distinguish any speed advantage over its dual- or even single-core predecessors in day-to-day use the user interface is not as immediately responsive as samsung s standard-setting galaxy s iii nor are its animations anywhere near as fluid along with the sluggish camera app this unimpressive performance leaves you feeling rightfully underwhelmed by the new four-core lifestyle the xperia z isn t slow but it doesn t feel especially fast eitherthe challenge for all of the incoming quad-core devices this year is to prove that there s a benefit in doubling the processor count yet again sony has certainly failed to do that with the xperia z and given the fact that dual-core chips already offered performance far beyond what any mobile app could require it doesn t look likely that anyone else will either android phones have enough processing grunt as it is what distinguishes them from one another these days are the phone maker s software optimizations and additions to harness that power sony finds itself sadly lacking on both fronts here the issue isn t that the xperia z performs poorly it s that this phone s billing and the company s ambitions aimed at the top of the pile whereas the experience of actually using it is straight out of the middle of the pack wrap-up compare it sony xperia z 7.2 verge score 9.1 user score write review good stuff stamina mode is a boon for battery life rugged yet handsome construction water- and dust-resistant headset is excellent for bass-heavy music bad stuff limited viewing angles mediocre ergonomics sub-par camera performance playstation mobile remains woefully underdeveloped sony s best android phone to date is merely decent by the broader market s standards much like the xperia s that came before it the xperia z suffers from the unfortunate duality of being both sony s best phone to date and a merely average android handset there s just no getting around the fact that sony remains one step behind the competition it stacks up a heaving spec sheet just as specs begin to matter least it introduces an all-glass design just as others start to move away from it and most importantly it fails to provide a compelling argument for purchasing it ahead of htc samsung or even lg s alternatives water and dust resistance is a rare and valuable trait for a phone of this size and the battery stamina mode is legitimately useful but together they just don t add up to enough to make this device truly desirable sony loyalists and android purists will find a few things to like however the xperia z s lasting legacy will be one of unfulfilled potential and inadequate differentiation the breakdown more

available on any us carriers so if you re considering picking up sony s best smartphone yet be prepared to spend at least 700 on an unlocked import customers in the uk and some other countries will find better deals some carriers are already offering the z for free with a contract engadget calls the xperia z the most beautiful sony phone yet though the site found the phone s 1080p display wasn t as good as the one on htc s droid dna engadget also found the xperia z s battery life to be disappointing slashgear also declared the z to be sony s best smartphone to date pointing out that it has the best display sony has used a solid camera useful waterproofing even if it does force annoying flaps on you and sleek albeit conservative styling like engadget slashgear had problems with the phone s battery life if you re looking for a sleek modern smartphone that will stand up to london s rain and you can charge it regularly the xperia z is an appealing option us customers however are likely to find better options through carriers or with other unlocked models such as the lg nexus 4 '),(336,'2013-04-22 21:29:18',7.0,20,'I want to believe . . .'),(337,'2013-04-19 00:00:00',7.0,20,' photo by maurizio pesce/wired how many times a day do you touch the power button of your smartphone according to sony mobile the average number of button-presses is 76 no surprise then that the company has put so much engineering detail into that big round silver button sticking out of the right-hand side of the xperia z handset among the crop of lookalike android phones this alone makes the z stand out it doesn t stun you with awe or anything but this new handset is certainly more of a looker than those awkward xperias of yesteryear oddly it s not yet available from a u.s carrier but it s a worthy contender if you re looking for an unlocked device to hack or to play around with photo by maurizio pesce/wired unveiled this past january and released soon after in japan where it s a big hit the newest xperia smartphone is encased in an all-black rubbery fiberglass frame and it features tempered-glass front and rear panels just like the old iphone 4 and 4s it s not gorilla glass though something you ll notice after a few days of normal use by accidentally scratching the glass you ll also find yourself repeatedly wiping both sides free of fingerprints and detritus for some reason the smoother all-white version of the phone collects less gunk or at least wears it better than the black version even so the xperia z is dust-resistant so while it may soil it won t get damaged it s also water-resistant meaning it would survive a plunge in three feet of water for up to 30 minutes all the ports and connections including microsd microusb 2.0 with mhl hdmi headphone socket and sim tray are sealed with flaps to keep everything waterproof i dunked my review unit in the sink let it sit under cold running water for a few minutes and i tossed it in a puddle outside all with no damage at all one thing though the air-tight build traps the heat in and when holding the z tight in your hands you ll sense it heating up across the back as the hardware gets busy photo by maurizio pesce/wired this is sony s flagship for 2013 so it has all the specifications you d expect a big powerful screen some hot-dog internals and an excellent camera the hd display is an 1920 1080-resolution tft panel with the latest iteration of sony s bravia engine working behind the scenes to boost the color saturation the screen is also very sharp 441 pixels-per-inch which is on par with the samsung galaxy s4 s 441 ppi however boosting the brightness hurts black levels and viewing angles are not the best i ve ever seen slim and reasonably light it doesn t look very large but it feels huge when you hold it at least as big as many of the other 5-plus-inch smartphones on the market inside is a 1.5ghz quad-core snapdragon s4 pro processor backed by 2gb of ram it also supports a full range of wireless connection capabilities so it will work almost anywhere in the world as i mentioned it s already a popular choice among buyers in japan and in limited european markets but it isn t available in the u.s yet customers stateside can buy the device unlocked at full price and use it on gsm hspa or lte networks sony is a company with a long history in photo hardware so you d expect the camera to be nothing short of fantastic the xperia z delivers by packing a 13.1-megapixel exmor backside-illuminated sensor pictures can be taken at up to 12 megapixels 3920 2940 in 4 3 ratio and up to 9 megapixels 3920 2204 in 16 9 it can take stills while capturing 720p mp4 videos too it also has a burst mode with the ability to capture up to 14 frames per second my own tests at the highest quality registered a fast 7 fps the camera software includes nine different filters and 17 scene modes plus a superior auto mode and a panorama mode that lets you select from all four shooting directions there s no dedicated shutter button and at the beginning it will be easy to mistake the power button for a shutter you d be better off enabling the touch capture mode which lets you fire the shutter by just tapping on a subject on the screen photo by maurizio pesce/wired although battery is rated at 2330mah it won t last a whole day between charges in fact the phone will be dead within six hours even if you re not a heavy user sony s main solution for increasing battery life is something the company calls stamina mode it disables mobile data when the screen is off but you ll still get texts and calls you can turn notifications on and off facebook twitter whatever to save power there s also an option that automatically loads saved location data whenever you re in range of a known wi-fi network and passes that saved data to any services that request it instead of pinging the gps sony ships the xperia z with android 4.1.2 jelly bean software but you wouldn t know it unless you burrowed into the settings the whole user interface has been customized by sony and it comes with a heap of bundled apps music unlimited playnow socialife sony car and wisepilot sony select and trackid most of those are take-it-or-leave-it i was however impressed with the customized keyboard that supports gesture input and bilingual words suggestions plus a number of optional extras including text-to-speech output emoticons and smart period and comma keys if you re not a fan of sony s customizations you ll be happy to know the z can run cyanogenmod finally there s the nfc chip which is mostly used for transferring files among supported android devices and for easily connecting to supported accessories most notably sony s various tvs dlna hardware bluetooth speakers and other wireless do-dads sony is good about goosing its own ecosystems and in the near future the z will tie into the company s mobile gaming offerings too sony says you ll soon gain the ability to pick up your handset and continue a game you started on the playstation thanks to the gaikai cloud gaming service sony bought last summer for 380 million a bookmark will always know where you left off but not yet also not yet buying the z through a u.s carrier if you want it stateside you have to buy it unlocked on the open market and jump through a hoop or two to get connected so fire up google translate and bring your wallet also be on the lookout for the xperia zl a cheaper version of the z without the water-resistant stuff or the glass back sony is putting more muscle behind the flagship z but the zl is already available in canada and through some online outlets wired dust and water resistant awesome screen awesome camera connects to 4g lte hspa and gsm networks i m awfully fond of that power button tired battery won t last more than six hours stamina mode helps but making it all the way to bedtime is still a challenge gps is very slow port caps feels fragile maurizio pesce is

trial games the psp proves itself a good not great multimedia companion for starters we found that the headphone sound volume is not very high which could be a problem for those listening to music or watching a movie on the subway storing music and photos on the memory stick duo is not very intuitive it is necessary first to create a main directory named psp and subdirectories for music photos and video or the psp will not acknowledge that the files are present you don t get the full complement of playlist and eq features you would see on a dedicated music player and unlike with dedicated portable media players such as the archos pocket video recorder line there s no way to capture video content from tv and get it on the psp directly practically speaking for video you ll be limited to

update the psp automatically goes out over the internet to search for and apply the latest patches that said we wonder why a device that can get you online so easily lacks a built-in web browser

of the release of the iphone 3g s for a full analysis of the iphone os 3.0 software update please see our iphone 3g s review for ongoing coverage please see our full coverage of the apple iphone photo gallery apple iphone from the moment apple announced its iphone at macworld 2007 the tech world hasn t stopped asking questions because apple has kept many iphone details under wraps until very recently we ve been forced to speculate until now is the iphone pretty absolutely is it easy to use certainly does it live up to the stratospheric hype not so much don t get us wrong the iphone is a lovely device with a sleek interface top-notch music and video features and innovative design touches the touch screen is easier to use than we expected and the multimedia performs well but a host of missing features a dependency on a sluggish edge network and variable call quality--it is a phone after all--left us wanting more for those reasons the iphone is noteworthy not for what it does but how it does it if you want an iphone badly you probably already have one but if you re on the fence we suggest waiting for the second-generation handset even with the new 399 price for the 8gb model down from an original price of 599 and 499 for the 16gb model it s still a lot to ask for a phone that lacks so many features and locks you into an iphone-specific two-year contract with at amp t we ll be more excited once we see a version with--at the very least--multimedia messaging and 3g design on with the review the iphone boasts a brilliant display trim profile and clean lines no external antenna of course and its lack of buttons puts it in a design class that even the lg prada and the htc touch can t match you ll win envious looks on the street toting the iphone and we re sure that would be true even if the phone hadn t received as much media attention as it has we knew that it measures 4.5 inches tall by 2.4 inches wide by 0.46 inch deep but it still felt smaller than we expected when we finally held it in comparison it s about as tall and as wide as a palm treo 755p but it manages to be thinner than even the trend-setting motorola razr it fits comfortably in the hand and when held to the ear and its 4.8 ounces give it a solid if perhaps weighty feel we also like that the display is glass rather than plastic display the iphone s display is the handset s design showpiece and is noteworthy for not only what it shows but also how you use it we ll start off with its design at a generous 3.5 inches the display takes full advantage of the phone s size while its 480x320 pixel resolution 160 dots per inch translates into brilliant colors sharp graphics and fluid movements menus in true apple style the iphone s menu interface is attractive intuitive and easy to use in the main menu a series of colored icons call out the main functions icons for the phone menu the mail folder the safari web browser and the ipod player sit at the bottom of the screen while other features such as the camera the calendar and the settings are displayed above it s easy to find all features and we like that essential features aren t buried under random menus fluid animation takes you between different functions and you can zip around rather quickly much has been made of the iphone s touch screen and rightfully so though the apple handset is not the first cell phone to rely solely on a touch screen it is the first phone to get so much attention and come with so many expectations depending on what you re doing the touch screen serves as your dialpad your keyboard your safari browser and your music and video player like many others we were skeptical of how effectively the touch screen would handle all those functions touch screen fortunately we can report that on the whole the touch screen and software interface are easier to use than expected what s more we didn t miss a stylus in the least despite a lack of tactile feedback on the keypad we had no trouble tapping our fingers to activate functions and interact with the main menu as with any touch screen the display attracts its share of smudges but they never distracted us from what we were viewing the onscreen dialpad took little acclimation and even the onscreen keyboard fared rather well tapping out messages was relatively quick and we could tap the correct letter even with big fingers the integrated correction software helped minimize errors by suggesting words ahead of time it was accurate for the most part the apple iphone features a virtual qwerty keyboard still the interface and keyboard have a long way to go to achieve greatness for starters when typing an e-mail or text message the keyboard is displayed only when you hold the iphone vertically as a result we could only type comfortably with one finger which cut down on our typing speed using two hands is possible but we found it pretty crowded to type with both thumbs while holding the iphone at the same time what s more basic punctuation such as periods or commas lives in a secondary keyboard--annoying if you re a frequent texter or an e-mail maven we suggest a test-drive first we also found it somewhat tedious to scroll through long lists such as the phone book or music playlists flicking your finger in an up or down motion will move you partway through a list but you can t move directly to the bottom or top by swiping and holding your finger on the other hand the letters of the alphabet are displayed on the right side of the screen by pressing a letter you can go directly to any songs or contacts beginning with that letter but the lack of buttons requires a lot of tapping to move about the interface for example the talk and end buttons are only displayed when the phone is in call mode and since there are no dedicated talk and end buttons you must use a few taps to find these features that also means you cannot just start dialing a number you must open the dialpad first which adds clicks to the process the same goes for the music player since there are no external buttons you must call up the player interface to control your tunes for some people the switching back and forth may be a nonissue but for mutlitaskers it can grow wearisome criticisms aside the iphone display is remarkable for its multitouch technology which allows you to move your finger in a variety of ways to manipulate what s on the screen when in a message you can magnify the text by pressing and holding over a selected area and as long as you don t lift your finger you can move your magnifying glass around the text you can zoom in by pinching your fingers apart to zoom out you just do the opposite in the web browser you can move around the web page by sliding your finger or you can zoom in by a double tap and when looking at your message list you can delete items by swiping your finger from left to right across the message at that point a delete button will appear thanks to the handset s accelerometer a fancy word for motion sensor the iphone s display orientation will adjust automatically when you flip the iphone on its side while using the music and video players and the internet browser also a proximity sensor turns off the display automatically when you lift the iphone to your ear for a conversation all three are very cool the january 2008 update added new customization options for the iphone s home screen by pressing and holding any icon all of the icons on the display will start to wiggle you then can move the icons around and rearrange them at will by moving them to the right you can also access a second menu page and you can add or remove on the dock at the bottom of the display it s clear that with this new feature apple is readying the iphone for more applications particularly as the company prepares for the upcoming sdk to stop the icons from wiggling just press the home button exterior features the iphone s only hardware menu button is set directly below the display it takes you instantly back to the home screen no matter what application you re using the single button is nice to have since it saves you a series of menu taps if you re buried in a secondary menu on the top of the iphone is a multifunction button for controlling calls and the phone s power if a call comes in at an inopportune time just press the button once to silence the ringer or press it twice to send the call to voice mail otherwise you can use this top control to put the phone asleep and wake it up again you can turn the iphone off by pressing and holding the button the apple iphone speaker is located at the bottom of the phone located on the left spine are a volume rocker and a nifty ringer mute switch something all cell phones should have and which is a popular feature of palm treos on the bottom end you ll find the speaker a microphone and the jack for the syncing dock and the charger cord unfortunately the headset jack on the top end is deeply recessed which means you will need an adapter for any headphones with a chubby plug is this customer-friendly no unfortunately the phone does not have a battery that a user can replace that means you have to send the iphone to apple to replace the battery after it s spent apple is estimating one battery will keep its full strength for 400 charges--probably about three years worth of use the cost of the replacement is 79 plus 6.95 shipping no you don t really need a removable battery in a cell phone but like many things missing on the iphone it would be nice to have especially for such an expensive phone and just what are you supposed to without a cell phone during the replacement period contrary to earlier reports the sim card is removable via a small drawer on the top of the iphone but other at amp t sim cards will not work in the iphone that s especially troubling as it completely defeats the biggest advantage of using a gsm phone with a sim card some people have multiple phones and like to change the sim card between their different handsets also you can t use the sim card to import contact information from another handset features the iphone s phone book is limited only by the phone s available memory each contact holds eight phone numbers e-mail web site and street addresses a job title and department a nickname a birthday and notes you can t save callers to groups but you can store your preferred friends to a favorites menu for easy access you can assign contacts a photo for caller id and assign them one of 25 polyphonic ringtones we should note however that there s no voice dialing and you can t use mp3 files as ringtones other basic features include an alarm clock a calculator a world clock a stopwatch a timer and a notepad there s a vibrate mode but it s a tad light the calendar offers day and month views and you can use the calendar as an event reminder or a to-do list as well the interface is clean and simple though inputting new appointments involves a lot of tapping there s no week view however we were able to sync our outlook contacts and calendar and our yahoo e-mail address book with no problems bluetooth and wireless the iphone offers a full range of wireless functionality with support for wi-fi and bluetooth connectivity the wi-fi compatibility is especially welcome and a feature that s absent on far too many smart phones when you re browsing the web the iphone automatically searches for the nearest internet hot spot bluetooth 2.0 is also on board which delivers faster transmission and a longer range than bluetooth 1.2 you can use bluetooth for voice calls but you don t get an a2dp stereo bluetooth profile--another item that s not necessary but would be nice to have though apple ceo steve jobs has explained the iphone s lack of 3g support by saying the chipsets take up too much room and drain too much battery we d like the option anyway yes the wi-fi network is great when you can get it but at amp t s edge network just doesn t cut it for all other surfing edge web browsing is so slow it almost ruins the pretty web interface more on this in the performance section messaging and e-mail for your messaging needs the iphone offers text messaging and e-mail as on many smart phones a text message thread is displayed as one long conversation--a useful arrangement that allows you to pick which messages you d like to answer the january 2008 update added the ability to send a text message to multiple recipients it was a welcome addition but truly that capability should have been there from the start if you use another function while messaging you can return to pick up that message where you left off we just don t understand however why apple doesn t include multimedia messaging sure you can use e-mail to send photos but without multimedia messaging you can t send photos to other cell phones--pretty much the entire point of a camera phone the iphone s e-mail menu includes integrated support for yahoo gmail aol and mac accounts you can set up the phone to receive messages from other imap4 and pop3 systems but you ll need to sweet-talk your it department into syncing with your corporate exchange server it s rumored that apple will update the iphone to support activesync but apple hasn t confirmed that as of this writing yet the iphone does offer a way to connect with your vpn you can read--but not edit--pdf jpeg word and excel documents worse you can t cut and paste text when composing messages iphone s ipod sandwiched between all the iphone s features lives apple s most amazing ipod yet the display interface video quality audio quality--all of it is meticulously refined and beautiful unfortunately it s trapped within a device that will cost you more than 1 000 a year just to own cnet recently reviewed a rolls-royce that had a top-notch umbrella hidden inside its passenger door buying the iphone for its ipod feature is a lot like buying that rolls-royce for its umbrella regardless the iphone is an exciting glimpse into what apple hopefully has planned for its sixth-generation ipod apple has redeemed itself following the motorola rokr e1 debacle the apple iphone s music player lets you view album art on paper the iphone s ipod doesn t offer any features not already on a fifth-generation ipod podcasts videos music and playlists are all here and content management with itunes is identical the difference rests entirely in the iphone s interface we ve used other mp3 players that use touch interfaces such as the archos 704 iriver clix and cowon d2 but

arrived bearing a mildly tweaked design and a load of new features with access to a faster 3g wireless network microsoft exchange server e-mail and support for a staggering array of third-party software from the iphone app store the new handset is the iphone we ve been waiting for it still lacks some basic features but when compared with what the original model was year ago this device sets a new benchmark for the cell phone world with the iphone 3g apple appears to have fixed some call-quality performance issues we had with the previous model--in our initial tests the volume is louder with less background buzz than before the 3g reception could be improved however music and video quality were largely unchanged but we didn t have many complaints in that department to begin with price may well remain our largest concern new at amp t customers and most current at amp t customers can buy the iphone 3g for 199 for the 8gb model and 299 for the 16gb model if you don t qualify for that price--check your at amp t account to find out--you ll pay 399 and 499 respectively either way you ll pay 15 more per month 74.99 total for a plan comparable with the original iphone 59 per month so while you ll pay less outright to buy the handset you ll make it up over the course of a standard two-year at amp t contract so should you buy an iphone 3g if you haven t bought an iphone yet and have been holding out for a new model now is the time if you re a current iphone owner and you re yearning for a faster cellular network then you should take the plunge but if you re an iphone owner who won t use 3g or can t check your coverage at at amp t then you should stick with your current model the iphone 2.0 software update provides exchange server support third-party apps support and many new features without the added cost prizefight blackberry storm vs iphone 3g design you d be hard-pressed to notice any design differences on the front of the iphone 3g the minor changes--the silver rim is thinner and the silver mesh behind the speaker--are so minimal we didn t notice them for a few hours after picking up the device turn the phone on its side however and you ll see more changes apple has replaced the aluminum silver back with a plastic face in either white or black the black version our review model is attractive but we admit that we miss the original silver which shows fewer fingerprints and smudges than the shiny black version the white model is not our cup of tea from the front the two iphones look almost identical the iphone 3g s edges are slightly tapered to accommodate the curved back making the device thinner around its perimeter than its predecessor but a hair thicker 0.48 inch versus 0.46 inch in the gut unfortunately the curved back makes the iphone 3g wobble slightly if you use it while resting on a table--which quickly becomes annoying the phone s height and width measurements 4.5 inches by 2.4 inches remain the same though it weighs just a tiny bit less 4.7 ounces versus 4.8 ounces we love the iphone 3g s flush headset jack at 3.5 inches and 480x320 pixels the display is the same size as its predecessor but displays slightly more dots per inch 163 vs.160 and still cranks out brilliant colors sharp graphics and fluid movements the layout of the home screen is identical to that on the first version though you ll see two new icons from the outset a contacts icon takes you directly to your phone book and the app store icon opens the itunes app store the display s glass surface accelerometer feature touch interface and secondary menus remain the same tiny screws can be found on the bottom of the iphone 3g the iphone s 3g controls reveal a few changes but none will surprise a current iphone user the home button sits below the display while the volume rocker and ringer mute switch rest on the left spine the power/sleep button rests on top of the phone in its normal position all controls are now silver instead of black the sim card slot hasn t moved either and apple now includes a sim removal tool in the box the bottom of the iphone houses the speaker the microphone and the charger port but you ll also notice two tiny screws on either side of the charger jack think maybe you ll be able to replace your own battery now bummer the battery is still not user-replaceable so we don t recommend trying it although we hear the battery is no longer soldered down we re very pleased that the iphone 3g s 3.5mm headset jack now sits flush with the surface of the phone allowing you to use any 3.5mm headset you like you re no longer restricted to a headset that can fit in the previous phone s inane recessed jack in the box you ll find the syncing cable a display cleaning cloth a headset user documentation the aforementioned sim removal tool and an electrical outlet plug the plug is pleasantly smaller than on the original iphone s but it s compatible with a standard usb cable on the downside you don t get a syncing dock if you want one you have to shell out 30 for it boo and apple made sure the iphone 3g won t fit in the first iphone s dock features the iphone 3g hangs on to all the original iphone features and throws in a few more so we ll concentrate on what s new lucky for first-gen iphone owners most of the impressive array of additions--save 3g support and enhanced gps--come along with the free 2.0 software update for more on the organizer features stocks and weather widgets youtube app notepad threaded texting and visual voicemail see our original iphone review exchange server support worker bees worldwide have awaited the iphone 3g s full support for microsoft exchange server in our tests adding an exchange account was ridiculously easy once we had the correct settings from our it department--simply choose to add a new e-mail account in the main settings menu and you ll be taken to the standard list of available e-mail systems microsoft exchange and mobileme will appear at the top of the list just above the choice for gmail you ll then be prompted to enter the applicable e-mail address domain/username server and password the authentication process took just a couple of minutes installing cnet s security certificate posed a bit of a challenge but we eventually succeeded by mailing the certificate to ourselves through yahoo mail the iphone 3g offers settings for exchange server and mobileme e-mail accounts once you re ready to go the iphone will sync your outlook e-mail contacts and calendar be advised that while the iphone can support multiple pop3 accounts at once two yahoo accounts for instance it syncs with only one exchange server and worse with only with one calendar or contacts list at a time if you have a separate personal calendar your work calendar will replace it once you start the sync you ll be notified before it happens as an alternative though you can sync e-mail without syncing your contacts and calendar also you can keep work and personal e-mail accounts open at the same time although you ll have to switch between the two unlike on a blackberry mobileme is another way to work around this restriction but we ll talk about the later when using wi-fi e-mail syncing went quickly as new messages came in the iphone registered them almost immediately it seemed to bog down when we received a large clump of messages at one time however in those cases we had to update the phone manually but even then the connection could freeze in one instance an update took almost 5 minutes--long enough that we had to back out of the e-mail app and try again later we also noticed that if the iphone loses its wi-fi connection the syncing is interrupted even if the phone has 3g service the syncing via 3g was just as quick if there was a difference we didn t notice it but if the 3g connection is shaky it will take longer when we deleted a message on our phone the same e-mail vanished on our pc just a couple of seconds later messages deleted on the pc took longer to disappear from the phone typically we had to do a manual update to see them gone messages deleted on the phone will show up in your pc s recycle bin and vice versa when the data connection is weak deleting and moving messages can be problematic there were a few instances when the iphone would not let us delete a random message but when we go back to our computer the message was indeed in the trash you can access all folders in your in-box and move messages from your in-box to a specific folder you can t search for messages but you can call a contact if they include their phone number in their e-mail opening attachments worked as promised and we like how you now can save attached images directly to your photo gallery simply by tapping the image to e-mail photos you will need to do so in the traditional manner by opening the photo selecting the e-mail option and choosing which account you d like to send from we had some difficulty forwarding big attachments--on a couple of occasions we had to try multiple times to send the message on to a colleague also the iphone was not able to show imbedded jpeg images on e-mails the e-mail syncing is not without its faults and it can t measure up to a blackberry just yet but it is a good step toward making the iphone a business device your experience will depend on how you use e-mail throughout the day if you get scores of messages and you must respond to each one then we d suggest holding off for now but if you get scores and only respond to a few or you just get a few then you could be perfectly content with the experience though according to at amp t using exchange server support on the iphone 3g will require the business data plan the one that costs 45 per month we re not sure how at amp t will enforce this rule the iphone does not prompt you of this restriction in any way mobileme the iphone 3g supports apple s new mobileme service which synchronizes from mac s mail address book and ical applications contacts calendar appointments e-mail messages photos and browser bookmarks one advantage of mobileme is that it allows you to sync personal and work calendars and contacts check out our mobileme review for a full analysis app store when you select the itunes store you re taken to the app store main menu which somewhat resembles the mobile itunes store in design you search applications by name and category and you can browse through the lists of featured applications or the top 25 there also is a feature for seeing if your purchased applications have any updates the mobile iphone app store we purchased a few apps for the iphone downloads over wi-fi were pretty quick most apps took just a few seconds but keep in mind it will vary by the size of the app though you can purchase itunes songs wirelessly only through a wi-fi connection you can download applications of 10mb or less over a 3g network and even over edge if 3g isn t available downloads over 3g took about the same time as they did over wi-fi give or take a few seconds but apps over edge are quite pokey we also purchased applications through the online itunes 7.7 store we downloaded super monkey ball and then synced it to our phone--a new applications tab appears under the iphone menu the process was quick and painless what s more navigation through the online apps store is easy after loading apps the icons will appear on the home screen what s most remarkable about the online applications store is the sheer breadth of titles available many of which take full advantage of the accelerometer as of this writing there are 27 pages available in a extensive range of categories if there is one thing about the iphone that s to love it s the app store--even if not all the applications are keepers and apple is maintaining strict control over who gets in sure apple is not the first company to build a phone that takes third-party applications but like the iphone itself the app store is unique not for what it does but for how it does it the process is so easy that we can t imagine having the same experience on a windows mobile device of course before you get carried away remember that some apps are free but others will cost you 3g the iphone 3g s support for at amp t s wireless umts wireless broadband network comes too late for original iphone buyers who grew frustrated with the slow web-surfing speeds over the 2.5g edge network but it makes for a much more satisfying second-generation device safari consistently delivered speeds of about 300kbps to 500kbps and even faster at times in our tests that s a huge jump over the typical edge speeds of less than 100kbps web pages that used to take minutes took only seconds to load via 3g continue to next page 1 2 editors top

recording the 3g however remains an excellent choice for folks who want to truly hold the internet in their hands iphone 3g the basics the 3g is a big slab of touch screen with a single home button the display is a 3.5-inch 320 by 480-pixel panel with multi-touch capabilities and it s a little bit brighter than the previous iphone s screen there s a thin metal bezel around the screen and the back of the handset is plastic it s also slightly rounded the iphone wobbles a little on a table if you push on its edges the plastic back attracts fingerprints like nobody s business a metal grill over the earpiece and speakers helps improve the sound quality a standard 3.5mm headphone jack along the top accepts any pair of music headphones a dock connector on the bottom hooks up to a wide range of speakers and other accessories such as medical monitoring equipment you still enter data on a touch keyboard that corrects your spelling but still doesn t offer any haptic feedback that turns a lot of people off but it s still one of the two best touch keyboards in the business along with the lg dare s and with the iphone 3.0 update the keyboard now rotates into wide mode not only for entering urls but for typing text and e-mail messages the basic array of iphone applications includes the phone contacts ipod itunes store app store safari youtube mail text threaded sms and mms

come to your rescue just flick to the left of the home screen and start tapping letters and it will search for apps contacts notes and messages containing your terms the phone offers 8 gb of storage and that s fixed there s no removable memory card slot the iphone s disappointing 2-megapixel camera has absolutely no settings options including no video recording though it tags your photos with gps data if you want a better camera you ll have to get a 3g s model battery life is pretty good we got 5 hours 43 minutes of talk time which is very good for a 3g phone audio and video playback came in at an impressive 37 hours 30 minutes for music and 7 hours 53 minutes for video we also streamed data continuously over 3g to simulate heavy use and we achieved 4 hours 45 minutes of use in here s a funny thing about the iphone though those battery results are very good but you may still feel that your iphone has short battery life that s because people use their iphones much more than they do other devices rest assured though that the battery is as good as it could be given the current state of the technology.next so how about that phone back to top 1 2 3 ..

fingerprints making watching videos on the phone much more enjoyable the 320-by-480-pixel screen is slightly brighter with a little more shadow detail the iphone 3gs also has increased storage capacities and prices compared to the 99 8gb 3g a 16gb model costs 199 and a 32gb one 299 otherwise it may appear there aren t many differences between the 3gs and the 3g but appearances can be deceiving apple has made it clear this phone is faster than the 3g but not really how much faster or what that means according to various independent analyses because apple isn t saying the 3gs is only the second phone along with the palm pre to use an arm cortex-a8 processor a significant architectural step beyond the arm11 used in the iphone 3g and most other high-end smartphones the graphics chip has been similarly boosted the results are very impressive boot time has dropped from 47 seconds with the original 3g to 20 launching the new york times app takes 8 seconds it used to take 22 google earth s start time has dropped from 24 seconds to 15 opening the weather app needs only 1 second down from 4 action games such as need for speed underground feel easier to play with no stuttering and much smoother controls the whole iphone experience is more seamless the internet seems much faster as well the iphone 3g and most other smartphones always appeared to access the net slower than at amp t s network would allow because of processing limitations the faster processor and additional memory in the 3gs raise apparent network speeds in safari from 550 kbps to 900 kbps as big a jump as at amp t s promised 7.2 network upgrade will deliver next year web pages also render much more quickly the time needed to access expedia.com over an 802.11g wi-fi connection dropped from 15 seconds to 9 and frommers.com over wi-fi dropped from 36 seconds to 25 raw internet speeds measured by a native speed-testing app were also much faster an average of 1 454 kbps down on at amp t s 3g network as opposed to 1 002 kbps with the 3g model just as exciting as this speed boost is where software developers will be able to take this new hardware apps tend to expand to consume available power and iphone developers especially game developers had hit the 3g s limits the 3gs clearly opens up new vistas more power doesn t mean shorter battery life the 3gs managed 11 hours and 30 minutes of video playback time which is a major jump over the 7 hours and 53 minutes we saw with the 3g talk time was more on par 5 hours and 27 minutes compared to the 3g s 5 hours and 43 minutes with continuous 3g data streaming i got 5 hours and 4 minutes with the 3gs the 3g did 4 hours and 45 minutes in day-to-day use i expect the 3gs to have about the same battery life as the original iphone one to two days but if you re upgrading the 3gs may feel like it has more battery life simply because a new phone s battery is fresher than the one in an older phone the new phone s other major feature its improved camera is a mixed bag the video camera mode can be excellent as long as you re outdoors in decent light in that case you get 640-by-480 video at a smooth 30 frames per second fps sure it washes out bright areas but it s the best i ve seen on a u.s camera phone and it s definitely good enough to include in your imovie projects using the camcorder indoors lowers the frame rate to 15-24 fps in a worst-case low-light situation you get dizzy jerky vertiginous recordings the camcorder smartly uses the accelerometer to ensure that both portrait-mode and landscape-mode video are right side up so you don t end up with videos rotated 90 degrees you can do very simple video trimming on the phone itself and post your videos to mobileme or youtube still-camera performance is less groundbreaking yes the new camera is 3.2 megapixels and quick with almost no shutter delay but it s a somewhat fuzzy 3.2 megapixels taking rather dim indoor shots and severely washing out bright areas outdoors the tap to focus feature also alters the exposure based on what you re focusing on which helps bring out some shadow detail on dark objects the 3gs camera is still way behind dedicated digital cameras or camera-focused phones like the motorola motozine zn5 in quality the 3gs also has a compass and i can t say much about it except that it works if you need a compass you ll probably be very happy the compass also adds some minor enhancements to the map application for example double tap find me in a map to reorient the map so it s facing the right direction presumably third-party app developers will use the compass to develop useful new navigation apps turn-by-turn direction applications enabled by the compass and built-in gps have already started to appear in the app store the iphone is still a stellar music and video ipod with one major advantage over the older 3g model stereo bluetooth works much better music played over altec lansing backbeat 903 bluetooth stereo headphones had much less distortion than on the iphone 3g otherwise ipod performance was very similar clear music sharp video and lousy included earbuds although this year s model has a volume control

october 24 2011 we lowered the rating of the iphone 3gs following the release of the iphone 4s photo gallery apple iphone 3gs three years after the first rumors of an apple cell phone began to make the rounds the iphone continues to garner huge buzz long lines and a growing share of the cell phone market and as we approach the second anniversary of the first model s frenzied launch day apple drops the newest model in our laps the iphone 3gs which will hit stores june 19 promises faster processing and network speeds extended battery life more memory and additional features it s enough to get our attention but not enough to get us completely excited in many ways the iphone 3gs delivers on its promises the battery which could sometimes deplete in less than a day on the iphone 3g lasted longer in our preliminary tests and the phone s software ran noticeably faster yet we still have some concerns a faster at amp t 3g network isn t going to happen overnight and some features like tethering and multimedia messaging aren t scheduled until later in summer 2009 we also struggled to see any change in call quality which as any iphone owner can tell you remains far from perfect so should you buy it that will depend on how much you ll have to pay for the privilege if you don t own an iphone yet and you ve been waiting for the right model now is the time to go for it the same goes for iphone classic owners who never made the jump to the iphone 3g but if you re a current iphone 3g owner the answer isn t so clear if you re eligible to upgrade at the cheapest prices 199 for the 16gb model and 299 for the 32gb model we suggest doing so as long as you don t mind the required two-year contract if you own an iphone 3g but are not yet eligible for the upgrade we recommend upgrading to the new iphone os 3.0 operating system and then waiting as much as the iphone 3gs brings it s not worth the extra 200 that the 16gb and 32gb models cost ipod touch os 3.0 media features design and interface the iphone 3gs looks exactly like the previous model it shares the shape and the same external controls but the iphone 3gs is unique in a handful of ways you can get both memory sizes in white or black and the iphone 3gs display sports a fingerprint-resistant oleophobic coating that is supposed to attract fewer fingerprints and smudges the new model shares the same dimensions as its predecessor but it s slightly heavier 4.76 ounces versus 4.7 ounces a virtually unnoticeable difference the iphone 3gs has the same external design as the iphone 3g the menu interface is also the same but in the past year as we ve added apps to the home screen something new has begun to bother us as intuitive and simple as the interface is it becomes unwieldy after you get above four menu pages swiping through multiple pages is tedious and it s rather painful to drag applications from page to page if you re an organizational freak we hate that there s no way to categorize related apps into folders such as one for news another for social networking and so on not only would this cut down on menu pages but you d also be able to find your app faster and while we re at it how about letting us delete some of the native apps we never use features since the iphone 3gs inherits many of the features from the previous model we ll concentrate on what s different on this device if you need a refresher on such elements as the clock youtube weather ipod player calculator and e-mail please see our iphone 3g review we ll start off with the new features that only the iphone 3gs will offer camera until now the iphone s camera has been good but far from great with decent photo quality but no editing features apple didn t include options such as white balance a digital zoom or a self-timer that come standard on many basic vga camera phones the minimalist shooter bothered us so much that we began to worry if apple was leading a new trend of dumbing down cell phone cameras the iphone 3gs camera still lacks a flash the iphone 3gs puts some of those fears to rest apple boosted the camera s resolution to 3 megapixels and added a new tap to focus feature as you point the lens toward your subject a small box appears on the center of the display tapping that square focuses the camera automatically on that point and adjusts the white balance color contrast and exposure accordingly if you d rather focus on the edge of your shot just tap the display at your chosen point and the square moves with you if you don t tap anywhere the camera will focus the entire frame photo gallery iphone 3gs camera photos tap to focus performs well for example if we photographed a book cover sitting on a desk we were able to get a clear reading on the book s title if we shifted the focus away from the book the title became somewhat blurry alternatively if we focused on the brightest part of an image the entire picture would appear brighter but if we focused on the darkest part of any image the photo would darken accordingly the iphone still doesn t come with a flash though so don t expect miracles on the other hand the new automatic macro setting didn t appear to make much of a difference close-up shots looked slightly better on the iphone 3gs than they did on the iphone 3g but we couldn t tell when the macro focus was working and when it wasn t as with the autofocus feature the macro setting is a welcome addition but we d prefer to have more control over it in other words the iphone 3gs camera is smarter than those on the earlier iphones but the camera rather than the user still runs the show the iphone 3gs indoor shots were just average on the whole the iphone 3gs photo quality looks better than the 3g camera s quality but it depends on the shot outdoor shots and photos taken in natural light looked less blurry in our tests with brighter colors photos taken during cloudy days were less likely to be blown out and photos in low-light conditions looked brighter and had less of an orange tint indoor shots without natural light showed little change however the iphone s camera is not optimized for fluorescent light for a full gallery of shots taken with the camera see our iphone 3gs camera slideshow video recording the iphone 3gs is the first iphone to offer video recording another feature other phones have offered for years apple makes up for some lost time by offering an easy-to-use video-editing option right on the phone the video recorder has a simple interface and you can edit clips right on the display controls for video shooting work just like the still camera s controls and you can use the tap to focus feature here as well the quality is just vga but the camera shoots at 30 frames per second so while colors look muted and some videos appear washed out the iphone 3gs did better at handling movement than most cell phone cameras after you re done recording you can send your clip in an e-mail or upload it directly to your youtube account we were able to upload to youtube and send a video from our synced imap4 exchange account but when we tried to send a video from a synced yahoo pop3 account an error occurred we re checking with apple on the discrepancy and will report back watch a video of the iphone 3gs video quality the phone s video-editing tool is utterly intuitive and fun to use after loading a previously shot video you ll see it displayed frame by frame in a linear format along the top of the touch screen using your finger you can slide the cursor to any point in the video and start playing from there if you care to edit just touch either end of the border that surrounds your video when the border turns yellow you can shorten the clip by dragging either end toward your desired cutoff point the image on the display will conveniently change as you move along once you ve made your edits just hit the trim control we liked the video-editing feature a lot but it s worth noting a couple of small complaints first off when you trim a clip the edited version replaces your original video rather than saves it as a new file also you can trim only in a linear format--meaning you can t cut out something in the middle and stitch the remaining two ends of the video together we also like a new feature that allows you to quickly open a photo or video that you just shot after taking your snap or video a small thumbnail will appear on the bottom of the viewfinder next to the shutter control tapping that thumbnail takes you to the photo gallery page from where you can view your work or send it on to a friend voice control we ve long berated apple for not including voice dialing on previous iphones particularly in this age of hands-free driving laws overdue as it is the new voice control feature goes far beyond just making calls to activate it hold down the home button until the voice control feature appears with the voice control feature you can make calls and control the ipod player as with hundreds of other cell phones voice control lets you make calls by speaking the contact s name or phone number into the receiver after you say your command you ll get audio confirmation and the name or number will show on the display if the iphone makes a mistake you can press an undo touch control at the bottom of the screen the feature is speaker-independent so you won t need to train it to recognize your voice you ll be ready to go the first time you turn on the phone in our tests the voice dialing performed well when using names it understood us accurately most of the time it made occasional mistakes--for example it wanted to call siemens instead of stephen --but that s hardly unusual for a voice dialer voice control performed better when using only numbers we didn t have to speak loudly except in noisy environments but it was capable of filtering out most background noise if you call a contact with multiple numbers but don t specify which number you prefer it will prompt you with home work etc if you ask for a name that has multiple listings in your phone book we know multiple people named tim for instance it will prompt you for your choice while showing the options on the screen alternatively you can call a contact using his or her company s name but that company must be in the contact s electronic business card voice control also interacts with the iphone s ipod player and the itunes genius list you can ask it to play a song by artist name and album and you can request an entire playlist once music is playing you can pause skip to the next song and go back to the previous track using your voice say shuffle and the player skips to a random song the feature was accurate most of the time but it occasionally confused some artist names unsure which song is playing you can find out by asking what song is this you ll then get audio confirmation of the track name and artist like what you re hearing say play more songs like this and the player will use your itunes genius list to play a related song in either case the music will dim while you speak they re nifty features to be sure and we can t think of another mp3 player or cell phone that offers such capability on the other hand we can t imagine that many people would use it outside of a car and the ipod voice control isn t perfect it read pink s name as p n k in our tests pink spells her name as p nk on her album covers and it twice tried to call annette when we asked what song was playing also we re not sure how gwen stefani would feel about being related to britney spears in the genius list but there you have it compass you ll find the iphone 3gs digital compass option directly on the home screen just tap to open the attractive interface shows a large compass with your bearing and your latitude and longitude similar to any other compass it continues to point true or magnetic north as you turn around reception was spotty inside so you ll need to stay clear of any interference if it can t get a bearing you ll be advised to move away from the interference and re-establish the compass orientation by moving the iphone in a figure-eight motion continue to next page

touch-controlled iphone in june 2007 in july the next year it rocketed to faster network speeds with the iphone 3g while creating a massive ecosystem of apps now on june 19 apple will reassert its dominance by shipping the iphone 3gs outfitted with the operating system upgrade iphone 3.0 it s not as dramatic an advance as the previous ones but the new phone introduces a long list of improvements big and small taken together they re enough to re-establish apple s once-shrinking lead in a brutal technology competition that is making the chariot race in ben hur look like a stroll in the park the iphone 3gs combines two sets of advances the first group is available only to purchasers of the new hardware the rest of the features are part of apple s iphone 3.0 software upgrade which beginning june 17 will be offered free to those with earlier iphones ipod touch users can get the new software for 10 i ll talk about the hardware-based features first as promised apple has indeed ramped up the speed with which the new phone performs tasks like launching apps loading web pages and displaying graphics apple claims speed boosts of up to two times of what the 3g delivers and in some benchmarks cites even better performance i haven t done scientific measurements but you don t need a stopwatch to notice the new phone is zippier than its predecessor i appreciated getting box scores faster and videos playing sooner in the mlb.com at bat application and it was clear that web pages loaded faster in the case of a game like tiger woods golf the boost is significant enough to make me more likely to play when i don t have much time photos were a weak spot in previous iphones they weighed in at a measly 2 megapixels but the iphone 3gs has a 3-megapixel autofocusing camera that s more sensitive and allows you to choose an object to focus on by tapping on it no zoom though bummer better yet the camera also records quite creditable video after you shoot your clip there s a dead-simple function to for instant editing after which you can send your masterpiece to youtube or mobile me with a single tap the iphone 3gs also has a hands-free feature called voice control by holding down the home button you simply say who you want to call or what music you want to hear this also works with the expanded controls in the new headphones included with the phone it s very useful though it did better at figuring out the people i want to call than it did with music when i said call diane levy home the 3gs dialed my sister s home number on the first try but when i said play lou reed it played lucinda williams when i said lucinda williams it played gillian welch close but no guitar pick still even with some false starts voice control is easier than fumbling through the ipod menus a difficult task while walking and a dangerous one while driving another 3gs feature is a compass which on its own isn t too thrilling you can get a real compass in a gumball machine but will eventually shine in a number of upcoming apps the first of these is google maps where an extra tap on the locate button will orient the map to the direction you re facing of the features that aren t exclusive to the 3gs but instead are part of the iphone 3.0 suite the biggest news is that you can finally cut copy and paste text photos and objects on an iphone sadly this isn t part of comprehensive iphone multitasking a feature delivered superbly on a rival phone the palm pre apple s reluctance to embrace multitasking is based on its claim that it would wear down the battery and it s true that the pre has a power issue so cut-and-paste will have to do for now as you d expect apple imaginatively uses its touch interface to make this feature intuitive and fun trust me describing how to do it is much more complicated than actually doing it the new software addresses another previous gap by allowing users access to a bigger keyboard in landscape mode not just in the safari browser but in mail and other apps this makes apple s soft keyboard much less prone to constant mistypings iphone 3.0 also offers deeper search functions you can now search through the contents of your iphone and get results that include apps contacts e-mail calendar and notes and e-mail search quickly locates messages both on the phone and with imap or exchange systems on a remote server other iphone 3.0 features that work as advertised are voice memos a straightforward audio recording app improved parental controls and auto-fill on safari there s also a more compelling reason to sign up for apple s 100-a-year internet service mobileme as before mobileme users automatically have calendar mail and contacts synced but now those with mobile me can take advantage of find my iphone which you call in to action when your device is lost or stolen using your computer you can locate the phone via gps very handy if you left it in a restaurant you can also put a message on the screen and trigger a two-minute ringing sound that will turn on even if the ringer has been switched off the latter is perfect for those who lose the phone around the house if the phone is really lost you can then remotely wipe out the data to foil snoopers i would suggest one further wrinkle a small capsule of indelible red dye that would explode on remote command splattering all over the swine who stole your gizmo there were two highly touted features i could not test out mms messaging sending media files via a text-messaging-like service and tethering using the iphone s modem to connect a computer to the internet the problem is not apple which has built these into 3.0 and will instantly offer them in other countries but at amp t the exclusive u.s network carrier at amp t promises to deliver mms for no extra cost later this summer and says that tethering will be available at a future indeterminate date almost certainly at an extra cost a lot of the new value of iphone 3.0 will come when all these features and others i don t have room to mention are exploited by the thousands of developers writing iphone apps you ll see apps that can sell things in the course of using them such as extra levels of a game apps that make use of your itunes playlist and apps that take advantage of p2p connectivity for head-to-head gaming and quick exchange of information in short the 3gs offers a boatload of improvements on the iphone 3g with no real downside and the same price brand-new iphone customers should have no hesitation before buying considering the huge variety of apps there s no better smartphone to buy today current iphone users have a tougher decision ahead first they must ask themselves if the features offered exclusively on the phone as opposed to the free upgrade which they should download immediately are worth the expense of a new phone for some users voice control the new camera and the speed boost will be worth the cost for others it won t be a huge sacrifice to go without complicating the matter is att s upgrade policy generally those who are in the second half of their two-year contracts can upgrade to iphone 3gs for the same price as paid by new customers 200 for the 16-gb version and 300 for the 32-gb the 32-gb version is the one to get especially if you ll be using video and other media at amp t has just announced that people who bought 3g phones as late as september will be eligible for the new-phone price all those cases involve a new 2-year contract obligation but more recent 3g buyers won t get that deal at amp t will charge them either 400 or 500 depending on the storage to upgrade to a 3gs with a new 2-year contract obligation another alternative is to pay full price for an unsubsidized iphone a whopping 600 for the 16-gig 3gs and 700 for the 32-gig version despite the fact that those buyers are relieving at amp t of the burden of its subsidy they get no discount on their monthly bills in part because of this and in part because apple is offering many of its innovations as part of the general iphone 3.0 upgrade the wise thing for those more recent buyers to do will be to install the new software and stick with their 3g iphones at least until their contracts run down this will provide a saner upgrade path to the 3gs s considerable but not earth-shattering improvements speed is wonderful but sometimes it s prudent to wait for it digg_url http igg.com/apple/apple_iphone_3gs_wired_com_product_reviews wired faster more storage better camera with video recording capability search encompasses more data not just one app at a time voice navigation feature-rich iphone 3.0 software is free to current iphone users tired multitasking still limited no tethering or mms support yet for at amp t users recent iphone 3g customers must pay a fortune to upgrade '),(352,'2011-02-02 00:00:00',9.1,67,' conclusion we like it this iphone raises the bar over not just earlier iphones but all smartphones with its incredibly sharp retina display a sleek new design and a front-facing camera although it lacks its successor s personal assistant siri and packs a slower processor than the 4s the iphone 4 remains a great choice if you want the iphone experience at half the price of the newer model and if you re worried about the death grip issue which in fairness has since been solved in the 4s a case should significantly help with reception issues and protect your investment '),(353,'2010-06-23 00:00:00',8.3,67,' slide 2 slide 3 slide 4 slide 5 slide 6 slide 7 slide 8 slide 9 slide 10 slide 11 previous next cnet

64gb model the bottom line with the iphone 4 apple again shows that it is a powerful player in the smartphone wars it won t be for everyone the call quality and reception vary if you don t use a case and at amp t s network remains a sticking point but the handset s striking design loaded feature set and generally agreeable performance make it the best iphone yet msrp 299.00 low price 440.00 amazon.com 440.00 see it set price alert photo gallery apple iphone 4 editors note in light of apple s decision to offer free cases for the iphone 4 s antenna we are not changing our original iphone s 4 rating we are however withholding the editors choice rating because of the attenuation issues that we experienced we updated this review november 22 2010 to reflect the new features from ios 4.1 and 4.2 we made additional updates on march 10 2011 to reflect the addition of the hot spot from ios 4.3 on october 4 2010 apple added an 8gb version of the iphone 4 on october 25 2011 we lowered the rating of the iphone 4 following the release of the iphone 4s with a revamped design a sparkling new display a speedy processor and additional features the iphone 4 is the biggest upgrade to apple s smartphone since the iphone 3g it s also the showcase handset for apple s newest operating system ios 4 which adds a selection of long-overdue features plus some smaller tweaks that we weren t expecting if they existed independently iphone 4 and ios 4 wouldn t be much more than blips on the smartphone radar screen when combined into one handset however the result is a sleek satisfying and compelling device that keeps apple strongly competitive in an increasingly crowded marketplace indeed the iphone 4 is fast the new hardware is a looker and some of the new features blew us away on other points however we have some concerns call reception still is problematic and you ll need to use a case or bumper to avoid any issues with touching the new antenna on the features side we welcome multitasking with open arms but it has its drawbacks also though the facetime video calling feature is more than noteworthy we wonder if our interest will last longer than a week so should you buy it if you re an iphone fan you ve probably already ordered your new baby but if you re on the fence think carefully we won t say that the iphone 4 is the best smartphone on the market today to do so would ignore so many great competing handsets not to mention the fierce rate of change in the technology world if you prefer apple s vision of a polished highly organized and slightly closed user experience then by all means you ll be pleased just remember to get that free case but if you prefer a smartphone that offers more personalization that isn t shackled to at amp t or that is equal parts phone and mobile computer then there are plenty of smartphones in the sea the iphone 4 is available exclusively with at amp t in the u.s and with other carriers around the world with a new two-year contract at amp t customers will pay 299 for the 32gb model or 199 for the 16gb version without a contract you ll pay 699 or 599 respectively but the phone will still come locked to at amp t and hey apple how about a 64gb version design though the iphone 3g and the 3gs models simply tweaked the original handset s design iphone 4 marks a sharp departure from those previous models admittedly we never had a problem with the look of the previous handsets but we approve of the iphone 4 s changes the front and back sides are glass both surfaces are flat and a stainless steel border circles the entire phone though it s a tad boxy it also has a clean svelte and unmistakably apple look what s more we love that the flat back means that the phone no longer wobbles when resting on a table you can get the iphone 4 in both black and white but here again we prefer the former the iphone 4 s rear face is made of glass so much glass is shiny and beautiful but we have a couple of concerns despite the oleophobic coating on both the front and back sides the glass attracts smudges by the ton also even though apple ceo steve jobs promises that glass better resists scratches and cracks than plastic we ll be watching long-term durability the iphone 4 has a solid sturdy feel though we didn t love its sharp corners it survived a few drops to a carpeted floor but we wonder how it will withstand traveling in a pocket with keys and coins luckily the apple-supplied bumper will offer needed protection even if it takes away from the handset s sleek profile time will tell how it holds up to heavy use the iphone 4 left compared with the iphone 3g at 4.5 inches tall by 2.3 inches wide by 0.37 inch deep the iphone 4 is as tall as the iphone 3gs but slightly thinner--25 percent to be exact--and narrow when measured across its front face it does feel smaller when compared with its predecessors but we don t think that s a bad thing jobs called it the thinnest smartphone around but since that race changes daily it may not hold the title for long when put on the scales it comes in at 4.8 ounces which is back to what we had with the first iphone both the 3g and 3gs models were slightly lighter we attribute the extra girth to the bigger battery so we re not going to complain and more to the point the difference is barely noticeable user controls other new design elements include a new front-facing vga camera a new led flash with the main camera lens and a new noise-cancellation microphone on the phone s top side needless to say we welcome the additions since they represent new functionality see the features section for more details we also don t mind the new split volume buttons since they re a bit easier to grasp than the previous volume rocker the handset has a sturdy feel in the hand above the volume controls is the usual mute switch which apple also gave a small makeover in bigger changes apple moved the sim card slot to the right spine and switched to a micro-sim format just like the ipad according to jobs the micro-sim format allows more space for the larger battery just keep in mind that you won t be able to use a standard sim in the phone the remaining exterior elements are largely unchanged the home button is in its normal place below the display the 3.5mm headset jack and power key sit up top next to the aforementioned noise-cancellation microphone and the 30-pin connector microphone and speaker are where they belong on the iphone 4 s bottom end unfortunately and to no one s surprise you still can t remove the battery in the box come the usual accessories like the small wall plug a usb/30-pin connector cable and the standard apple earbuds oddly you do not get the sim removal tool that came with the previous models true you can use a small paper clip but we re miffed that we didn t get it apple didn t have an explanation for the omission the iphone 4 s antennas wrap around its thin profile antennas the stainless steel border is more than just decorative it doubles as two new antennas that circle the entire phone minus three small notches seriously leave it to apple s industrial design team to make an antenna pretty the first antenna which runs from the notch on the top of the phone to the notch on the left side is for wi-fi and bluetooth that leaves the second antenna which spans from the top notch down the right side and around to the bottom of the phone for edge and 3g though apple did not specifically promise that the new antennas would improve call quality or wi-fi reception their very existence is an indirect admission and the first that we ve seen by the company that data and voice reception have been troublesome and need to be addressed though current iphone users largely blame at amp t for connectivity problems remember that both a carrier s network and a phone s antenna play a part in reception yet as we mention below in the performance section the antenna didn t magically cure all reception issues in fact it even caused new problems display and interface sometimes the best gift is something that you didn t know you wanted and that s definitely the case with the iphone 4 s display it features a 940x640-pixel 326 pixels per square inch retina display which is four times the resolution of previous iphone models what s more it uses the same ips screen that s found on the ipad with an 800 1 contrast ratio though we ve always thought highly of the current iphone displays the company needs to compete with the gorgeous amoled screens and tft displays we ve seen on many android phones like the htc evo 4g and that s exactly what it s done the iphone s display is beautiful just above is the vga camera lens though stunning gorgeous and dazzling are words we usually use to describe high-quality smartphone displays we re not sure if they do the iphone 4 justice believe us that everything about this display is fantastic from the bold colors and graphics to the vividly clear text you can see it reasonably well in direct light and the details on web pages photos videos and applications are as sharp as they come but the best thing is that you can t see any pixels on the display it s quite remarkable and especially apparent when you hold it up next to the 3gs no we re not inclined to completely believe apple s claim that the display exceeds what s perceivable by the human eye but there s no denying that it looks good we haven t seen the yellow areas that users have complained about for more on the display see the full testing results from cnet labs of course the iphone 4 has the same ambient light sensor proximity sensor and accelerometer as the previous iphones we saw no change in their functionality we would have liked to see how flash videos tested on the display but you know how that goes features with a heavy load of new goodies the iphone 4 runs circles around its 3gs predecessor in bringing new features some are unique to the device and others come with the ios 4 update we ll cover the latter group first multitasking though you ve always been able to multitask with native iphone features like the music player the option is now available for third-party apps your primary access point is a multitasking menu that s accessible by double-tapping the home button once there you ll see a list of currently running applications along the bottom of the display that you can scroll through using a sideways finger swipe the pop-up menu shows only four apps at a time but you can keep many more in the tray the new multitasking feature is accessible by double-tapping the home button managing the multitasking menu couldn t be easier to open a running app scroll though the menu and tap its icon once when you re ready to end an app first use a long press on the related icon and then click the tiny delete icon in the top left corner switching among apps is a simple process as well as you move back and forth you ll return to the exact point you left there s also a clear sense of organization with the most recently used app on the left side all things considered it s a very apple experience but is it real as you d expect apple s multitasking works a little differently than on other smartphones instead of having all device resources available to every running app ios 4 lets only seven app services run in the background according to apple this arrangement will have less of a drain on resources like battery life and memory than if it gave developers free rein also since background apps essentially pause it will free the system from having to juggle resources and kill stalled applications so what can you do in the background apple s seven approved processes include audio you ll be able to play pandora radio for example voip services like skype gps/location for apps like tomtom push notifications and local notifications those that don t to have to go through a server task completion and fast app switching apps essentially hibernate not to use the cpu the latter two are most notable with task completion an app will finish something it s already started even if you send it to the background it will send you an alert when it s through fast app switching on the other hand is the app hibernation process that allows you to toggle back and forth quickly and return to the same place you left though some have complained that the built-in limitations mean that ios 4 doesn t have real multitasking we think incomplete is a better description granted you can t run everything in the background--your twitter feed for example won t update while paused--but ios 4 does allow you to run certain features from multiple apps simultaneously if that isn t multitasking then we don t know what is what s more it wouldn t be the first time apple limited features or took longer with development in order to produce a desired customer experience you may not agree with such a philosophy but apple has always been honest about pursuing it like so many things in technology it just comes down to what works best for you you can close apps in the multitasking menu nice but not miles ahead even after the long wait we re quite pleased with the multitasking experience as it has a talent for doing apple has presented the feature in a slick easy-to-use manner it performed beautifully without ever crashing or freezing the phone it didn t appear to negatively affect battery life and it accomplishes what it sets out do but even with strong points we wouldn t agree that it s the the best way to multitask a common apple claim it may be slick and save you a few clicks but other approaches--such as the deck of cards interface on webos--continue to impress similarly though limited multitasking may result in more-efficient power management we ll have to run comparison testing with other smartphones before we can agree we also don t share jobs view that apple s solution isn t a task manager when he unveiled ios 4 last april jobs took a dig at android and other operating systems that require you to close background applications that might be slowing down the phone in multitasking if you see a task manager...they blew it he said users shouldn t ever have to think about it fair enough but we think it s a matter of semantics as with most task managers the ios 4 multitasking menu allows you to scan through running applications and close any that you re no longer using granted you may not have to kill frozen applications as often as you would on say a windows mobile phone but you still have that option we also found usability quirks that are common with task manager apps pressing the home button once for example simply sends an app to the background it does not end it completely to do so you ll need to open the multitasking menu find the related icon and end it there and we couldn t overlook another point now that a double-tap of the home button opens the multitasking menu you can no longer use the control as a shortcut for a designated feature as such the option is gone from the setting menu a small price to pay for a new feature we suppose apps will come we know that some cnet users are concerned that many existing apps are not functioning in the background keep in mind that it will take time for developers to update their apps for multitasking capability apple plays no rule in making those updates so contact the individual developers for a time frame home screen folders though we love apps as much as the next person we ve become tired of scrolling through several pages of iphone home screens thankfully that has changed with the addition of home screen folders this is another common feature that competing devices have long offered so it s nice to see apple stepping up folders clear up space on your home screen to get started use a long press on the home screen so the icons jiggle when your icons are dancing they ll also have a tiny delete icon in the corner you can take an app and drop it on top of another to create a folder the folder will then appear as a square with tiny icons of the included app inside tap the folder to access the included apps and get an expanded view of the folder s contents alternatively if you want to remove an app just drag it back to the home screen it would be nice to able to designate one app icon as the cover of the folder but we realize we re nitpicking thankfully you re awarded a fair amount of flexibility for folder organization you can add as many folders as you like change the default folder name and add both related and unrelated apps surprisingly we could even group legacy features like the weather and stock applications into a single folder the process is easy but we wouldn t say it offers a huge change from the equivalent experience on android and really apple we re limited to just 12 apps in one folder e-mail and enterprise the iphone always has been a functional e-mail machine but we ve never enjoyed switching back and forth among multiple accounts to read new messages fortunately ios 4 has a new unified in-box that is accessible under the mail option on your home screen listed above your individual in-boxes is a new option for all inboxes which contains messages from multiple accounts you can t access individual folders from the universal in-box but you can delete and move messages here again it works well but it s not vastly superior to how competing oses handle the same process also the universal in-box doesn t always sync immediately with the inboxes for individual accounts other e-mail changes include the capability to add multiple exchange accounts organize e-mails by thread jump directly to individual in-boxes resize photos before you send and open attachments with a preferred app all are nice but we ll delve into a couple of our favorites for more detail e-mails in a thread will now be designated by a small number on the left side of the message header clicking the number will take you to a separate screen that lists all relevant messages it s a nice touch and we like that you can move or delete messages in the thread we also like the new option to delete e-mails directly from search results the iphone 4 s virtual keyboard is unchanged worker bees will get options like enhanced data protection mobile device management wireless app distribution support for exchange 2010 and ssl vpn from juniper and cisco home screen customization unlike the previous three features this addition was low on our wish list but apple s done a decent job rolling it out sure you always could change the standard black background using a third-party app but ios 4 adds the native capability to the iphone and ipod touch first find the wallpaper option in the settings menu and choose either a provided wallpaper or a photo in your camera roll after making your selection you ll have the option to set it as the wallpaper for your home screen the lock screen or both

camera cons cellular reception issues facetime video calling is limited bottom line apple s iphone 4 adds a gorgeous screen terrific camera and faster processor to add to apple s awesome app experience but voice calling still isn t this phone s priority by sascha segan the iphone 4 is the best iphone ever that s for certain it s the best media playing phone on the market a terrific camera phone and a truly awesome game-playing phone it easily makes the cut for our list of the 10 best touch-screen phones it s not the best phone-calling phone but we ve gone well beyond the era when everyone bought handheld networked computers primarily for making long voice calls folks who already have iphones will find this to be a dramatic upgrade the better screen speed and camera all change the iphone experience for the better anyone who wants to dip into the iphone s 225 000 apps will also love this phone it s not perfect but no one phone is perfect for everyone and the iphone 4 is still an editor s choice and one of our 10 best touch-screen cell phones view all 6 photos in gallery physical features the iphone 4 is thin and sharp apple has ditched the rounded organic look of previous models for an almost mid-century modern stainless steel band around two slabs of black glass all iphone 4s available right now are black a white model is coming soon apple says the result is a phone that s slightly smaller and noticeably thinner than all of its competitors at 4.5-by-2.31-by-.37 inches the device comes in two memory sizes 16gb and 32gb there s no memory card slot and apple cut down on the size of the sim card slot apple hates slots because they mar the phone s lines they re using tiny micro-sims now which shouldn t bother you much if you re in the us us users have no reason to ever remove the iphone s sim card most phones feel like gadgets because they re all metal and plastic the iphone 4 feels like jewelry because of all that glass the front of the phone is nearly-indestructible gorilla glass according to apple and the back is a different kind of tempered glass that will make the phones relatively resistant to scratches but i d still recommend a case if you want to keep yours looking pristine apple s retina screen is pretty great although it doesn t live up to its bombastic marketing copy what could the ips lcd technology used has incredibly deep blacks and noticeably richer colors than the iphone 3gs did the viewing angles are wider and it looks much better outdoors it s far more beautiful than any other screen technology i ve seen except for samsung s upcoming super amoled i look forward to testing those two technologies against each other the screen s 960-by-640 resolution is really important but not for the reason you think if your world consists only of apple phones the new resolution is a revelation text especially looks razor-sharp and web pages practically look like they were laser printed right onto your screen tv shows and movies look much better on the iphone 4 than on the iphone 3gs 99 you can see subtle details and richer colors it s like switching from a standard-def to a high-def tv but hold it next to a 3.5-inch 800-by-480-or-greater screen like the ones on the htc droid incredible 299.99 or motorola droid 249.99 and it s pretty hard to tell the difference unless you hold it really close and squint yes the iphone 4 s text is sharper but the other phones displays are still readable down to the limit of my 10/15-with-glasses eyesight the retina display leads the fight but the battle has gone beyond the limits of human perception the real reason for the retina display is to keep the iphone s 225 000 apps running smoothly by simply doubling the resolution from the iphone s 320-by-480 apple lets all the existing apps run without letterboxing or distortion this is incredibly important if apple had changed the screen s aspect ratio existing apps would have run with black bars across part of the screen that s not a seamless apple experience phone calls and facetime video calls the iphone 4 like the 3gs is a gsm/hspa 7.2 phone that operates on at amp t s and foreign 3g bands also like previous iphones it s not the greatest phone for voice calling cue the screaming nay-sayers if it s not the world s best voice phone what good is it a phone should be a phone yes that is a valid view there are phones for you the iphone 4 is not the phone for you move on there are millions of people for whom making long heartfelt voice calls isn t their primary desire they send scads of text messages play games fingerpoke on youface if they re tina fey and make brief voice calls to get their points across the iphone is for them if you re looking for salvation from dropped calls the iphone 4 isn t it in extremely weak signal conditions in our lab and our basement the iphone 3gs actually connected slightly more calls successfully than the iphone 4 did about one in ten additional calls went through the iphone 4 gave a truer picture of signal strength than the 3gs did though its bar meter is quicker to respond to changes in rf than the 3gs is apple also acknowledged that the iphone death grip is real and holding the phone the wrong way reduces signal strength i made speedtest.net data speed tests slow down and even stall out by picking up the phone and holding it in my left hand with one finger on each seam of the phone and the bottom-left corner against the pad of a slightly sweaty palm putting the phone down on the table caused the speed test to resume the death grip only made a difference on voice calls in weak signal conditions though with decent or strong signal it didn t affect the iphone s ability to connect calls adding one of apple s 29 plastic bumpers fixed the death-grip issue entirely the iphone 4 does improve call quality once calls are connected the earpiece is just excellent sharp clear and loud without distortion or gain problems the speakerphone which seems to emanate from the lower back of the phone is loud enough to use outdoors and considerably louder than the 3gs s too-quiet unit transmissions sound strong if a little bit tinny on the other end they re definitely less harsh than calls made from the 3gs the iphone 4 also stepped up noise cancellation with a dual-microphone setup and it shows while a little bit of background noise came through the iphone still isn t up to motorola droid x standards the iphone 4 cancelled background noise better than the 3gs and definitely well enough to muffle the sound of a refrigerated goods truck a few feet away from me the iphone s voice control is accurate extensive and worked with our aliph jawbone icon 199- 99 bluetooth headset perfectly including triggering voice dialing from the headset along with dialing numbers you can control the ipod functions from the headset which is really neat i wasn t able to get a full battery test done in time for this review so i ll update the review when i can but battery life looks on par with most other major smartphones about a day of average use facetime apple s video calling system is a gimmick for now remember when you could only send text messages to someone with the same wireless carrier facetime is even more limited your friend has to have the same model of phone and you both have to be in wi-fi hotspots and you have to remember to turn on your wi-fi that makes facetime a special-occasion parlor trick rather than a general purpose solution when you do get all the ducks in a row it works my facetime call was clear my own face appeared in a small window in the upper left hand corner of the screen while the person i was calling took up the whole screen you can talk through the speakerphone or a bluetooth headset and you can flip the view around to use the rear camera and show your correspondent what you re seeing though i found the image became pixelated very quickly when using the rear camera that said i got facetime to work on the first try which is a lot more than i can say for fring and qik on android in the land of the faceless is the one-faced man king or something like that mobile video calling in the us is clearly not ready for prime face time yet but a desktop or android facetime client coming in the next year could really change the situation by giving iphone owners more people to call next smartphone and app experience gt back to top 1 2 '),(355,'2010-06-25 00:00:00',8.0,67,' apple s fourth-generation iphone makes its predecessors look like toys heck even the ipad looks sissy now it s an impressive upgrade the iphone 4 ditches the curvy plastic case of the older models in favor of a thinner squared-off glass body laced with a stainless-steel band it has a higher-resolution display a brand-new front-facing camera an improved back camera with flash double the ram of the iphone 3gs and the same a4 processor that powers the ipad grip it in your hand and the iphone 4 feels like the phone of the future the defining feature of the iphone 4 is its 960-by-640-pixel display which has a pixel density of 326 pixels per inch far higher than any other consumer display apps websites photos and videos look stellar text is crisper images look rich and detailed and colors are stunning it s been hard to put down this phone staring at that screen is addictive the second most compelling addition is the front-facing camera which works with a built-in video-chatting client called facetime remember when george jetson s boss chewed him out on a video phone in the jetsons it looks a lot like that choose a contact then tap facetime and within a few seconds you ll see your buddy s mug better keep your finger out of your nose from now on video chatting is nothing new plenty do it with webcams on their computers already but video conferencing on a phone makes a dramatic difference as you have the liberty to take the camera with you wherever you go give a virtual tour of your new apartment to friends across the country hold a facetime chat with a retired co-worker and pass the phone around the office for everyone to say hello this new method of communication digital coexistence is fresh and exciting even to journalists who live and breathe gadgets every day there are some big limitations currently facetime is only available for iphone 4 users so the number of people you can video chat with is limited however apple published facetime as an open protocol any software developer can integrate the service into their third-party software on macs windows machines or even competing smartphones such as the htc evo 4g it s a mystery why apple hasn t already provided integration with its own desktop chat client ichat which would greatly expand the number of people you could video chat with second facetime only works over wi-fi until the carriers networks get better says steve jobs provided you have a strong wi-fi connection facetime works well and it s a blast with a weak or overloaded wi-fi connection it s an exercise in frustration and without wi-fi you can t use it at all that s stifling but for now most of us will probably be video chatting in more private settings where we presumably have decent wi-fi anyway so we ll let you off the hook for this one at amp t however at amp t s overloaded 3g network remains a major concern for old-school telephoning call quality sounds clearer with a noise-canceling microphone on top of the handset but reception problems persist we experienced plenty of dropped calls with the iphone 4 in san francisco network coverage varies from city to city and your mileage may vary but we can t file this away as a non-issue until either at amp t expands its network to accommodate data-guzzling iphones everywhere or apple shares the iphone with multiple carriers to mitigate overcrowding on at amp t s network adding to our cellular woes many customers have reported a strange antenna problem where squeezing the steel band on the bottom-left corner of the iphone 4 results in dropped signal strength that just happens to be the way many left-handers are naturally holding the iphone we were able to replicate this behavior but only by squeezing the iphone very hard jobs e-mail response to a concerned customer was to just avoid holding it that way which doesn t seem fair and apple s recommended solution is to buy a 30 protective bumper whatever the remedy when a number of people are complaining about the same issue and the proposed solution is a band-aid this appears to be a design flaw whether it s at amp t s network or apple s design the iphone 4 s semi-frequent dropped calls create the same old headaches this is still an unreliable phone period that s a shame because the iphone 4 is solid with just about everything else it does the new 5-megapixel camera up from 3 megapixels in the iphone 3gs takes photos that look better than a lot of dedicated point-and-shoots we ve used however white balance seems slightly off often appearing too yellow so you d benefit from touching up photos with an image-editing app also photos shot with the iphone 4 s new led flash look eerie as you d expect with an led flash did we mention the iphone 4 s snazzy back camera also shoots high-definition 720p video it looks great too with smooth motion and crisp clarity although the yellows again appear heavy finally the iphone 4 subtly improves on speed compared to the iphone 3gs it s not tremendously faster but you ll notice that complex tasks finish up more quickly in the photo-editing app camerabag for example photo processing took about a second per photo whereas on an iphone 3gs it took about three seconds the iphone 4 s main competitors are the crop of high-end android phones currently on the market the nexus one motorola droid x and htc evo 4g all have impressive hardware and match the iphone 4 nearly feature for feature in some cases exceeding the iphone 4 s specs as with the droid x s 8-megapixel camera any day now a manufacturer will likely deliver a better piece of hardware than the iphone 4 however apple is still far ahead of the curve with its new ios 4 software and ever-growing app store the entire experience of ios is far more elegant and intuitive than android and for many people that ease of use will outweigh ios 4 s relative lack of flexibility and its subpar telephone capabilities interestingly the iphone 4 has more ram than apple s other hot product the ipad with 512 mb in the iphone 4 compared to 256 mb in the ipad it also has two cameras a newer os and a higher-resolution display than the ipad which might inspire some buyers remorse among early ipad adopters with the iphone 4 apple has blown android rivals previous iphones and even the ipad out of the water it s that big of an upgrade and for now it s the uncontested leader in the smartphone market wired incredible display facetime video chat is futuristic fun thinner profile feels great in your pocket 5-megapixel camera could replace your point-and-shoot tired the phone one of the most important features is still frustratingly unreliable antenna flaw for some lefties is lame white balance in photos and videos is slightly off '),(356,'2011-10-12 01:00:00',8.6,68,' lt cdata util.loadscriptasync http latform.linkedin.com/in.js gt jump to up top hardware internals camera reception battery life software siri icloud video wrap-up comments down close if sbn.openx.istablet else reviewing the iphone 4s is in many ways a lot like reviewing the original iphone 4 except that it s not the device which was just announced at a special event on apple s campus is very much the same phone the company released in june of 2010 but it s also something completely new while much of that sameness comes from an identical physical appearance and nearly identical specs in some places there s much that s fresh here besides packing the successor to apple s custom a4 cpu appropriately dubbed the a5 inside the iphone 4s also sports an upgraded rear camera an improved antenna design and a new internal radio that allows the device to perform double duty on both cdma and gsm networks in reality however the hardware is only half the story maybe not even half the introduction of the iphone 4s marks the introduction of ios 5 as well the new operating system is loaded with big improvements from notifications to how your device connects to your computer packed with major features like icloud integration and an innovative voice-activated intelligent assistant named siri it s not unfair to consider this one of the most meaningful updates to ios we ve ever seen for a phone that s already being touted as one of apple s fastest-sellers it s hard to even suggest that the iphone 4s won t be a success but beyond pure market excitement is there enough in this new device to stand up to a steady wave of competition some which is awfully fierce i ll try to answer that question in my review below so read on for the whole story hardware hardware / design if this were a car it would be a mercedes as i stated pretty clearly in the opening paragraph of this review there isn t anything notable about the exterior of the iphone 4s in comparison with the company s previous flagship phone really if you ve ever seen an iphone 4 or even looked at photos you will have a crystal clear idea of what this phone is like that said the iphone 4 design does stand the test of time or 16 months in this case compared with most if not all of its android competition this industrial design looms tall though enthusiasts might be bored of seeing the same hardware for more than a year this still feels like the phone to beat in the looks department the glass back while incredibly prone to shattering on impact feels as sleek and sexy as ever the metal antenna and solid machined buttons feel high-end expensive even if this were a car it would be a mercedes it s kind of incredible when you think about it competing phone-makers have had more than a year a lot more considering the leaked photos of the iphone 4 prior to its release to best this design and yet no one really has as frustrating as it is to say this no other phone on the market comes close to this level of craftsmanship materials or considered design the iphone 4s may not be the most resilient phone in the world i ve broken two original iphone 4s in accidental drops but it probably is the most beautiful iphone 4s hands-on previous next view full gallery previous only the antenna design has changed next jdocument.readyfunction j gallery2251674 .gallery internals internals / display the iphone 4s is a gorgeous device with impressive specs unlike the exterior there are obvious improvements when it comes to the phone s internal components as i mentioned the device utilizes the dual-core a5 cpu the same as in the ipad 2 and based on spec monitoring software on the phone it s clocked at 800mhz that s not to say it feels slow however the device has 512mb of ram onboard which came as a bit of a surprise considering that s the same number as the ipad 2 and original iphone 4 you can purchase the phone in 16gb 199 on-contract 32gb 299 or 64gb 399 variations i tested the 64gb model for radios the phone has that dual-mode cdma / gsm chipset most likely qualcomm s mdm6600 wi-fi 802.11b/g/n and bluetooth 4.0 the phone also touts a digital compass gps chip accelerometer ambient light sensor proximity sensor and three-axis gyroscope but you knew that already didn t you the rear camera has been massively improved and that s saying a lot considering the original iphone 4 sensor and lens were a pretty lethal combo the iphone 4s now has an 8 megapixel sensor and improved optics which the company claims delivers point-and-shoot quality photos the phone is also capable of handling 1080p video the front-facing camera remains unchanged from the iphone 4 however clocking in at a measly vga resolution i ve got more on the rear camera below of course the display on the 4s is apple s well regarded 960 x 640 retina display and it looks no less impressive now than it did when the iphone 4 was first released one thing i did note however was how much less contrast-heavy the screen looks in comparison to the previous model the iphone 4s has a noticeably different color tone and blacks seem far less dark this isn t necessarily a bad thing when comparing dead space a pretty dark game side-by-side i found the iphone 4s display more eye-pleasing still the newer screen definitely has a slightly more green-tinted washed-out look compared with the older device i wish there were more to say about the differences between this model and its predecessor but the changes are simply very subtleotherwise the phone is unchanged i wish there were more to say about the differences between this model and its predecessor but the changes are simply very subtle there s no lte here no larger screen no new body design no set of stereo speakers it doesn t do 3d and apple didn t add a kickstand let s just say it was pretty easy to take this device on the street for testing still the iphone 4s is a gorgeous device with impressive specs on paper it may not stand up to the latest and greatest android phone with 4g radios a massive screen and a screaming 1.5ghz dual-core cpu but in use it s easily one of the most capable handsets on the market camera camera if you ve ever thought about using a phone as a replacement for your point-and-shoot feel free to start taking that concept seriously apple made a pretty big deal out of the new camera on the rear of the iphone 4s and after testing it for a few days i understand why the iphone 4 has a 5-megapixel shooter which when it was introduced was touted as being superior to other smartphone cameras this was thanks to a bigger sensor which let an increased amount of photon information pass through the lens a point steve jobs went to great lengths to explain at wwdc in 2010 there was no question that the iphone 4 camera was an excellent shooter but in comparison to the iphone 4s it s old news the sensor is not only larger on the new iphone but apple has further tweaked the optics to deliver better results even in low-light settings the company has updated the backside illumination sensor added a fifth lens element and increased the aperture to f/2.4 all of which sounds more interesting if you re a camera fanatic even if you re not however the improvements are obvious the second you start snapping pictures the iphone 4s took some of the nicest cleanest photos i ve ever seen from a mobile device if you ve ever thought about using a phone as a replacement for your point-and-shoot feel free to start taking that concept seriously the 4s produced crisp balanced colorful photos that were surprisingly low-noise and never over-saturated the iphone 4 sometimes seemed to be compensating for its limitations by exaggerating colors but the iphone 4s looks and feels like a real camera capturing true images you can see by this lower light comparison that the iphone 4s sensor is a vast improvement over the previous model the macro focus on the lens was particularly impressive allowing me to grab subjects including really gross insects at extremely close ranges i did have some minor issues with the focus not wanting to take in some situations but that may have had more to do with the focal limitations of the small lens than anything else as far as video is concerned it should come as no surprise that apple has done a similarly excellent job here too the iphone 4s captures full 1080p content and does so with the same crispness and polish that it lends to its still photos apple has introduced a number of improvements on the video side including image stabilization and it shows when you re shooting even relatively fast action there s not much to say except that apple has improved on what was already a capable video solution making it a full-fledged competitor for bulkier point-and-shoots or dedicated camcorders iphone 4s camera shots previous next view full gallery previous next jdocument.readyfunction j gallery2249608 .gallery reception reception / call quality during the announcement in cupertino apple made a point to call out the new or rather improved antenna design on the iphone 4s the company claims the phone can intelligently switch between its two antennas providing better call quality and presumably fewer dropped calls in my testing i did seem to be getting more bars more consistently though it s tough to say if it made any big difference in terms of call quality as far as dropped calls were concerned i certainly didn t notice any pronounced issues while testing the phone in new york i did have a few dropped calls but i also have dropped calls on my nexus s so i m a little more apt to blame the network than the device in terms of death grip worries i was able to get the phone to start dropping bars if i tightly held it on both the bottom and top of the device along the notches in the antenna this is of course a totally absurd way to grip a phone of course i was never able to really get the iphone 4 to show a big drop in signal so perhaps it requires a special touch the long and short of it is that in my testing with the iphone 4s i didn t feel that it exhibited any behavior that wasn t consistent with the performance of most devices i ve used on at amp t s network on verizon or sprint your mileage will obviously differ as far as download speeds are concerned while apple may boast about its improved hsdpa 14.4mbps maximum i didn t see much of a boost in most places i tested the phone at home with four out of five bars on 3g i never saw my downstream peak above 2.2mbps while my upstream held solid at around 1.5mbps that s consistent with other at amp t devices i ve tested but paltry compared with lte devices i ve used in the same spot i m sure there are some locations where you ll see a bump but just as with the previous phone data rates are clearly limited by what the network can provide the company claims the phone can switch between its two antennas providing better call quality battery life battery life / performance i found the battery performance of the phone to be impressive as with the iphone 4 the 4s is definitely no slouch in the battery life department in fact apple claims that the new phone is capable of an extra hour of talk time while on 3g what the company is less vocal about is the fact that the phone has lost an hour of wi-fi browsing time in my real world testing of the device those numbers seemed to balance each other out and overall i found the battery performance of the phone to be impressive even after a heavy day of use about 16 hours of making calls browsing downloading apps syncing listening to music game playing and more i still had juice on the phone when i plugged it in before bed the 4s is more than capable of going through a full business day without needing a charge and if you re a lighter user you ll rarely have to worry about it as far as processor performance is concerned the iphone 4s isn t kidding around though don t expect mind-blowing speed differences between this device and its predecessor in fact when comparing a graphically intense game like dead space side-by-side i didn t notice a dramatic difference in frame rates the 4s definitely had slightly less of the occasional stutter but it wasn t night and day on the other hand apps seemed to open a little bit faster and the camera response time is noticeably improved the 4s is definitely a snappy device but if you re going from the last version to this it feels like a tweak not an overhaul it s possible that newer software infinity blade 2 for instance will take better advantage of the a5 s capabilities but that remains to be seen software software as i said in my intro the big story with the iphone 4s isn t so much about the hardware as it is the software ios 5 is a huge update maybe apple s biggest ever and there s lots to unpack it s also important to note that most of these improvements will be found on the ipad and ipad 2 ipod touch 3rd and 4th generation iphone 4 and iphone 3gs it s not just the 4s that s getting an update for starters don t expect a completely new look and feel to the operating system ios 5 is nearly identical to the last version of the os save for some pretty notable improvements in functionality the biggest and probably most desired at least by more tech-savvy users is improved notifications gone are the maddening intrusive pop-over notifications we ve been living with since the first version of ios now when you get a message or new email you see a notification at the top of your screen which doesn t interfere with what you re doing on the phone you can swipe towards the left of the screen on these messages to make them disappear needless to say this is a welcome change from older versions of the software apple also takes a page right out of android s playbook and now utilizes an almost identical window shade to collect all of your notifications which you can open by swiping downward from the status bar inside the shade apple calls it the notification center you ll find updates from your apps which you can order manually or by most recent and apple has even included a couple of widgets for weather and stock information you can manage your notifications app-by-app and touching one of the messages takes you to that application apple has also introduced notifications on the lock screen when an item appears on your list and the phone is locked you can drag that specific notification across the screen to jump straight into the app it s actually pretty handy though hardly an original concept samsung android devices with touchwiz do pretty much the same thing the company has also included a new messaging component to its standard crop of sms and mms messages called imessage this service is unique in that it works across devices so the ipad and ipod touch get the app too and it syncs your communications on all of the devices you use with the same account many people including yours truly have described this as a bbm killer and in use it definitely feels that way not only is the service free and works across 3g or wi-fi connections but it does more than just send texts you can include photos videos locations and contacts and it will tell you when messages have been read by the recipient or when they re typing something back oh and it s really fast messages were delivered almost instantaneously if you re a blackberry user who s been reluctant to leave because of bbm this may be the piece that pushes you over the edge apple has also added some new applications to the mix reminders is a to-do list with some extra functionality like the ability to set locations as triggers for alerts so you can tell the phone to remind you about something when you arrive or leave a specific location it s a pretty neat trick though it takes some getting used to to make it a part of your workflow the reminders app also ties in nicely with siri a lot more on that in just a bit there s also a new content app called newsstand which is like ibooks for periodicals at the time of this writing apple hadn t flipped the switch on the service yet so i didn t have a chance to test it out when it is live you ll be able to get new issues of your favorite magazine or newspaper downloaded automatically to your device in the background the company has also made tons of little nips and tucks all over other pieces of the os twitter integration is now built-in so you can tweet links photos or videos without having to jump into the app the photos application has been updated to allow basic photo enhancement red-eye reduction and cropping safari has been updated to include tabs in the ipad version and is generally way faster on the iphone 4s than pretty much any other mobile browser i ve used in a side-by-side comparison with the last generation iphone the 4s seems blazing the new phone scored a 2246.8 in sunspider while the original iphone 4 clocked in at just 3591.3 apple has also added its own take on instapaper for the browser called reading list which lets you save articles to read later in a cleaner text layout it can also reformat a page you re viewing in the browser to make it more streamlined and interestingly to compact a multi-page article into a single page finally and mercifully apple has cut the cord on syncing by adding wi-fi syncing options that let you manage your phone almost entirely without a cable attached as long as you have the latest version of itunes you can sync apps music video and settings over your local network without plugging in you have to set the service up using a cord to start but then you re able to access and sync your device whenever and wherever you want on your network that is you can also now set up a new device out of the box with nothing more than an internet connection pc free as apple calls it worked mostly without issue for me though there were times when i couldn t get my laptop to recognize my phone on the network a reboot seemed to fix the problem and it s possible i was having issues because i was syncing two different phones to the same laptop the new software pieces are very welcome but there are things about ios that have begun to feel dated to me in particular the os still feels stuck in this mode of use where you re constantly jumping in and out of applications blindly either to get information or catch them up to the present that can be frustrating when you re trying to keep up with something like twitter though the app will alert you that you ve got new messages to read it doesn t download your content until you ve opened up the program and let it refresh the same is true for mail and even messages you receive in im or irc apps and i know i ve said it a million times but the fact that apple still doesn t provide auto-updating icons on its homescreen seems crazy to me yes we now have a weather widget in notification center but why doesn t the icon change too i feel like there s an entirely new market for developers just waiting to make widget icons think realtime clock faces like those just added to the ipod nano yet apple seems reluctant to give users more information on their home screens that lack of glanceable information coupled with the delay of having to open an app to get information creates a feeling of disconnect for me that i find bothersome having been using a nexus s prior to the iphone 4s i couldn t help but notice the pause however small that apple s os puts between you and realtime content every time you open an application even if it s saved your state you still feel like you re moments behind where you re supposed to be for the broad user base apple wants to hit with these products this will probably never be an issue but i do think there are places in ios 5 that still need work ios 5 is a huge update and there s lots to unpack siri siri siri is probably one of the most novel applications apple has ever produced the other major new piece of software on the iphone 4s and in this case only on the 4s is siri siri as i said in the intro of this review is something that apple refers to as an intelligent assistant and is probably one of the most novel applications the company has ever produced siri s premise is quite simple utilizing a combination of voice recognition logic processing and text-to-speech the software can interpret requests and follow conversations through siri you can use natural language to get directions send text messages schedule reminders or appointments get suggestions on where to eat and lots more not only does siri understand what you re saying to it it understands the context in which you re saying it so for instance if you try and schedule a meeting on top of another meeting siri will warn you and ask if you d like to change the time of your new appointment and it ll listen as you tell it a new time siri can also process and answer basic and not-so-basic questions utilizing the wolframalpha engine like how many cups are in a gallon and the software pulls in yelp data to help you find things like restaurants or movie theaters when in doubt siri will do a web search based on your questions siri also learns things about you and the people around you you can tell siri who your wife or brother is you can tell siri where you work and live the software will read or write text messages using voice commands and can also take dictation in any field where you can use a keyboard if you ask it things like do i need a raincoat today it understands and responds as a human being would you can tell it to wake you up at a certain time and it knows to set an alarm and if you ask siri how to get home from somewhere it ll give you directions in the maps application the crazy thing about siri is that it works at least most of the time better than you d expect it to it understands and responds to you in a way that s so natural it can sometimes be unsettling the software even has a good sense of humor asking it what is the meaning of life will bring up a number of responses both serious and not so serious the first time i asked siri simply said 42 if you ask siri if there s a god the software points you in the direction of the nearest church oddly no synagogues buddhist temples or mosques are suggested that s not to say the software which will be released in beta is without issues there s still clearly a lot of work to be done on the voice recognition side of things and a lot of pieces you might expect to work aren t wired up just yet for instance you can ask siri to list movie theaters nearby but the software won t tell you specific movie times or help you buy a ticket another ding is that in order to figure out questions and answers siri has to communicate with apple s servers that s fine if you re on wi-fi but there were a few times on 3g that the software seemed to take forever to process a question and deliver results apple told me that they were making some changes on the server side during the testing period so it s possible that some of that slowness had to do with issues unrelated to the basic tech at play siri can be helpful but was also frustrating at times seeing the software mangle a request or fail to understand what action you want it to take can be maddening but i think that frustration actually speaks to how advanced the software is siri is capable of doing so much that is complex that i started giving it more credit than was probably due i expected siri to be smarter than it is right now because well it s already pretty damn smart i think that says volumes about what to anticipate from the software moving forward siri may not be finished yet but it already feels like something straight out of science fiction icloud icloud apple s cloud service tries to pull it all together the final piece of the iphone 4s puzzle is icloud while not strictly a service just for the new iphone icloud is being introduced along with ios 5 so what does icloud do exactly well for starters it does pretty much everything mobileme did before it meaning web-based email contacts and calendar those three services will also sync to your devices but icloud does a lot more than that the service promises to keep your photos music and settings synced across devices using the icloud servers as a way point and container for most but not all of your content essentially what it does is keep a running tab of content you ve created or apps and music you ve purchased from itunes all of that content is beamed up to the cloud and then back down to your phone ipod touch or ipad to help you visualize how this works here are a few use cases you take a bunch of photos on your phone since you re using photo stream to sync these to icloud they get beamed up to apple s servers later when you open your laptop and start up iphoto the application pulls down all of those photos onto your local storage the same thing happens when you use your ipad with the same account and photo stream turned on you buy an app on your iphone later you want to put that app on your ipod touch you ll have access to that app on any of your devices in a list of purchased software in the app store all you need to do is download the app to your device you buy a new song in itunes if you have itunes in the cloud turned on that new purchase will sync down to all of your devices registered with the same account no fussing with syncing individually anymore the same goes for video and ibooks content too you re working on a document on your ipad in pages with icloud that document will be saved on your ipad then accessible through icloud.com for download or will be synced to your other devices running pages every time you update that document unless you re doing it in pages on your laptop it will be synced to the cloud essentially this is a rather static service which is constantly moving your content from your devices up into the cloud and back down to devices it s not flickr or gmail it s a way to keep content and devices in sync without hassle in its current state it works quite well though there are some catches in the service that you should probably make a note of for starters you get 5gb of storage for free which doesn t count your apps music books tv content or photo stream images you can upgrade that storage for a nominal fee starting at 20 a year for a total of 15gb up to 100 annually for 55gb of cloud storage secondly the way icloud handles your photos is that it will keep 1000 photos in the cloud for up to 30 days if you go beyond 1000 or past 30 days you start to lose your content unless you move it to a device say your laptop or to a folder in your camera roll if that sounds confusing that s because it is also there s no way to view your photos or share them online at this point i don t quite get why apple is putting a cap on how many photos you can store or for how long perhaps i m just used to services like picasa or flickr but i rather like the concept of having my photos stored somewhere in perpetuity and i like being able to share those photos to other people easily there s one other issue with photo stream that i find a little disconcerting once your pics have uploaded to photo stream you have no way to delete individual photos you can delete all of your photos and turn off the service thus allowing you to delete on your devices but you can t choose single files to delete by hand the moment you finish taking photos they re upped to icloud where they basically cannot be manipulated it s actually a bit upsetting it feels like you don t have full control over your content by the end of october apple will introduce one more component to its icloud offerings which is itunes match for 24.99 a year that service will find every song you ve ever purchased on itunes and make it available to stream on your devices and will also upload or match anything else you have in your collection whether you d purchased it in itunes or just ripped a cd the switch hasn t been flipped on itunes match so i didn t have a chance to test it out in all the basic icloud service which is free should go a long way to simplifying the experience of moving content to and from devices it s not perfect by any means but it solves many of the problems that ios users have struggled with since the introduction of the first iphone video video review wrap-up compare it apple iphone 4s 8.6 verge score 8.9 user score write review good stuff camera is stunning retina display is still best in class siri software is incredibly cool and surprisingly useful bad stuff ios is beginning to show its age improved 3g speeds don t seem very improved especially compared to lte devices glass and metal design is beautiful but easy to shatter the iphone 4s is an astoundingly good phone but the gap between this year s model and last year s model isn t as wide as apple would probably like this is the easy part kind of if you re an owner of an older iphone or someone looking to switch to an iphone from a different platform there s never been a better apple device to buy the iphone 4s is an astoundingly good phone between the hardware both inside and out and the software ios 5 as well as third party offerings it s just kind of an awesome package the lack of lte a larger display or a new design may put off some buyers but that won t change the fact that the 4s is a force to be reckoned with it s not exactly the same story as with the release of the iphone 4 where you felt like competitors had to go back to the drawing board completely but android and windows phone device makers will certainly be scratching their heads trying to figure out how to best what apple is offering the iphone 4s is a great device for some but what if you re thinking of upgrading from an iphone 4 that s a tougher call the phone is faster to be sure and has an amazing camera and of course you can t get siri unless you have a 4s.. but i just don t know if any of those reasons are compelling enough to convince previous buyers to upgrade the concept is a particularly hard sell for verizon customers the gap between this year s model and last year s model isn t as wide as apple would probably like for this review i returned to the iphone after a fairly long period of using and testing other devices spending a week with apple s newest phone i m reminded again of just what makes the company s products so special it s not specs services or apps this phone is not perfect certainly it can be improved but there is something here beyond the screen and cpu beyond icloud something under the surface some intangible spark is this the best phone ever made that s debatable but i can tell you this the iphone 4s is pretty damn cool the breakdown more times than not the verge score is based on

'),(357,'2012-05-09 00:00:00',9.4,68,' conclusion we like it the iphone 4s may not have the bigger display faster processor and access to high-speed data networks that come with the new iphone 5 however recent discounts mean that last year s iphone -- and a former gdgt must-have cellphone -- is now available for as little as 99 with a two-year contract that s a great price for what s still one of the best smartphones ever made while the iphone 5 is our current top must-have cellphone if you ve had your eyes set on an iphone and you re looking to save some cash you won t be disappointed with the 4s '),(358,'2011-10-11 00:00:00',8.0,68,' apple never specified what the s stands for in iphone 4s and it may as well stand for siri sure the fifth-generation iphone s superb camera and speedy dual-core processor are classy additions but siri is the reason people should buy this phone when i step out of my apartment today a reminder will pop up on my iphone 4s to deposit checks at the bank tonight i m meeting my friend peter who wants to eat steak so i can say i want prime rib to find steakhouses nearby i have a meeting with a colleague alexis this thursday and i can add that in my calendar just by saying schedule meeting with alexis on thursday at 3 p.m with siri and apple s new reminders to-do list app it s unlikely i ll forget anything important again because the process is so effortless i did all of this with the iphone 4s s new built-in app siri a voice-recognition technology that apple inherited when it acquired siri inc a san jose-based startup in 2010 the enhanced voice tool is an iteration on apple s previous voice control feature that debuted in the iphone 3gs in 2009 which only allowed voice-powered phone dialing and music selection to give you an idea of how convenient siri is it takes about three seconds to create a reminder with a voice command as opposed to the 10 seconds it takes me to manually type an event into a to-do list or calendar entry before with the standard iphone calendar i would often forget to add an event because i was too busy to type it and as a result i would forget i had something scheduled altogether with siri and apple s new reminders to-do list app it s unlikely i ll forget anything important again because the process is so effortless it s kind of like having the unpaid intern of my dreams at my beck and call organizing my life for me i think siri on the iphone is a life changer and this is only the beginning voice-powered artificial intelligence like siri and google voice are shaping up to become the next-generation user interface the first iphone s introduction of capacitive touchscreens were a major leap into making technology fluent to people of all ages and skill levels the sense of touch is one of the first experiences we become accustomed to after we re born so it wasn t surprising to see that even children and our grandparents could pick up an iphone or an ipad and figure out how to use it in seconds swiping tapping and pinching interactive objects on a screen no problem voice-controlled ui is the logical next step we learn how to speak when we re infants and most of us can talk faster than we type therefore as the technology matures voice commands will become the quickest way to get in and out of our phones until apple or google figure out mobile telekinesis just imagine what powerful voice-recognition software means for people who barely touch keyboards or mice and imagine how important this tool is for the visually impaired their lives are about to get much easier in the coming years voice control is going to be huge currently siri works with some core features of the iphone and apple s initial partners incorporating the voice-powered ai are wolfram alpha and yelp that means in its beta state siri is limited to controlling the iphone s built-in apps e-mail sms phone ipod calendar web search looking up directions finding restaurants or businesses with yelp or performing gimmicky calculations such as how many inches to the moon with wolfram alpha if you hold the iphone up to your ear siri is activated so it looks like you re talking to someone on the phone rather than talking to the phone itself you would think that dictating commands to a phone would look awkward in public but apple thought of a trick to make this less weird by default if you hold the iphone up to your ear siri is activated so it looks like you re talking to someone on the phone rather than talking to the phone itself clever huh i suspect most iphone 4s customers will primarily be using siri for controlling the iphone s default apps such as creating reminders setting the alarm clock and composing an e-mail or text message but if and when apple opens up siri to third-party app makers the possibilities are endless some hypothetical examples include using siri to pay your credit card bill through the chase app or to order your chinese delivery through grubhub or to book your flight through the kayak app seeing as google has already opened voice-recognition to android programmers it s a safe bet we ll see apple eventually allow third-party iphone apps to take advantage of siri too i ve spent a week with an iphone 4s loaned to me from apple and i got hooked on siri quickly creating reminders with siri was the most useful i found it silly however that items you create with reminders do not show up in the calendar app that means if i create reminders and calendar events i have to open two different apps to see everything i have to do i m hoping apple integrates reminders into siri in a future update the only other problem with the iphone 4s is that once you start using the robot assistant you ll wish it did a lot more it is limited but really good at what it can do so far here are some of my favorite examples from experimenting with siri me i m drunk siri i found a number of cabs fairly close to you perfect it didn t dial my ex-girlfriend me i have a flat tire siri i found 14 towing services 12 of them are fairly close to you me remind me to steal a ream of paper when i arrive at the office siri here s your reminder for when you get to work steal a ream of paper shall i create it me i m going to kill myself siri i found four mental health agencies three of them are fairly close to you this was just a test don t be alarmed and here are some examples of where siri let me down me book me a table at mission beach cafe tonight at 7 siri ok here s mission beach cafe it looks pretty close to you no option to book the restaurant that s disappointing because before apple s acquisition the older siri app had partnered with opentable.com to book restaurants for you me add steve urkel to my address book siri sorry brian x i m not allowed to create contacts shucks it still takes too long to add a new person to my address book and the third-party app bump for wirelessly swapping contact information is very poorly designed me lower screen brightness siri sorry i don t understand lower screen brightness this would be really useful because it takes too many steps to do this on the iphone normally me remind me to buy toothpaste when i arrive at safeway siri when would you like me to remind you turns out siri and the reminders app can t yet create a geo-fence for anywhere besides your office location or your home and dammit i forgot to buy toothpaste again when i was at safeway yesterday with all that said the list of what siri can already do is quite long and this is a great start it will be exciting to see where apple and presumably its army of app developers take voice-powered ai in the years to come performance camera and dual-antennae oh yeah the iphone 4s includes upgrades for the processor antenna and camera too the new apple phone has the same dual-core a5 chip as the ipad 2 and the performance boost will be most noticeable when playing games launching apps and browsing the web besides browsing and playing games the smaller parts that make up the whole ios experience all feel faster everything from typing to sending a text and from powering on the phone to taking a photo is zippier here s a quick sunspider benchmark comparing the iphone 4s browser speed with that of an iphone 4 running ios 5 less is better iphone 4s 2 232.2 milliseconds iphone 4 3 679.2 milliseconds besides browsing and playing games the smaller parts that make up the whole ios experience all feel faster everything from typing to sending a text and from powering on the phone to taking a photo is zippier apple also made several improvements to the iphone camera the camera sensor has a large 4.3 millimeter f/2.4 aperture lens which is getting close to the same size as a really good point-and-shoot camera the bigger the aperture the more light and clarity the camera resolution was upped to 8 megapixels and not only are the number of pixels increased more light gets into each pixel thanks to backside-illumination technology that basically means you can take artsy photos in low-light conditions my test shots in a dimly lit bar looked pretty good but in dark settings it doesn t hurt to just try shooting with the flash and then there s the antenna now that metal band surrounding the iphone contains two antennae for your cellular services and when you re on a call the handset will automatically switch to the antenna that s pulling a stronger signal from my experience talking on an iphone 4s on at amp t sounds noticeably clearer than it did on past iphones i ve owned in areas with good reception the handset still hasn t dropped a call and no i haven t experienced any degraded call performance when holding the phone the wrong way however in dead zones where there is spotty at amp t coverage pretty common here in san francisco the reception is still poor there s not much a phone can fix about an overloaded network even with a fancy dual antenna though these are all nice improvements the antenna camera and processor upgrades are minor compared to the addition of siri the previous iphone 4 already took great pictures for a phone the antenna was ok despite the notorious grip-of-death design flaw and it was already plenty fast siri is the fancy bow on the package that makes this a sharp upgrade overall should you upgrade for people who own an older iphone such as the 3gs or for those looking to dump a creaky android phone the decision is obvious the iphone 4s will be a big jump in performance camera quality and call clarity and siri will be a fat bonus if you re an iphone 4 owner thinking about upgrading you have a tougher choice to make thanks to the two-year contract imposed by at amp t and verizon you re not yet eligible to pay the 200 upgrade fee for a new phone so you d have to spend over 600 just to get the 4s i think it d be wiser for iphone 4 owners to wait another year for the next iphone which will probably be dubbed the iphone 5 and sport a radical new design and more internal enhancements if the pattern holds but be warned iphone 4 owners if you try siri for a few minutes reaching for that credit card will seem irresistible try not to give in i m betting that some clever hackers out there in the jailbreak community will figure out how to integrate siri into older iphones so if you re brave enough to tinker i suggest waiting to see what they come up with before blowing a huge wad of cash just to have siri the iphone 4s looks exactly the same as its predecessor but who cares if it was shaped even slightly differently or came in a new color people would still go nuts over the stuff that s more important anyway the insides and both inside and out this is a magnificent smartphone the late steve jobs once called the computer the equivalent of a bicycle for our minds i think of the smartphone as the rocket ship for our minds with increasingly powerful sensors and technologies and access to hundreds of thousands of apps enabling us to do just about anything the iphone keeps soaring to incredible heights and taking us to places with limitless potential i guess that s what you have to do to create a ding in the universe wired siri is the best androgynous unpaid intern you ll ever meet dual-core guts make for faster apps and a smoother interface camera is much-improved call quality gets a boost tired siri is limited in what it can do and understand looks the same as the iphone 4 what s up with that a two-year contract means you may not be eligible for the best upgrade pricing photos by jim merithew/wired

note on october 24 2011 we updated this review after performance testing on an at amp t iphone 4s on november 10 2011 apple delivered ios 5.0.1 which promised to fix the battery life issues affecting some users the update also fixed a security flaw that allowed third-party applications to add unapproved features for the first time since the iphone was born four years ago a new model didn t arrive in june this year the wait set the iphone 5 rumor mill frothing to overflow so when the iphone 4s arrived as an incremental upgrade fanboys commenced an internet-wide rending of garments some critics grumbled that they didn t get more and i sympathize...kind of yes the lack of 4g is disappointing and yes a totally new design would have been fun but this is hardly the first time that apple has chosen to make a subtle upgrade remember the iphone 3gs the truth is that the 4s brings healthy improvements to an already excellent device iphone owners finally get a 64gb model and a better camera the dual-core processor delivers more speed and siri the iphone 4s personal assistant/robot friend/gofer adds a new and sassy experience ios 5 also trots out changes big and small and we re glad to see sprint join the apple family with a true world phone so while the iphone 4s isn t the jesus phone it s quite enough for plenty of other people-- more than a million actually not everything impressed me i d prefer a slightly larger screen and my list of iphones misses remains hefty call quality and data speeds were better than on at amp t s iphone 3gs and iphone 4 but the carrier s network still struggles to compete with sprint and verizon remember that there will be a discernible difference between the 4s versions just like we found with the at amp t and verizon iphone 4s so it s important to choose your carrier wisely in the end the decision to buy an iphone 4s will depend on your current carrier contract if you aren t eligible for an upgrade with a rebate i don t think the new features are worth paying full price at least 500 but if you can upgrade with a discount or if you re a sprint customer waiting to get your hands on the iphone for the very first time there is enough here to warrant a switch sure there s the chance that a better iphone 5 will come next june but that s a long time to wait besides in the cell phone world something better is always around the corner design as i said the iphone 4s is indistinguishable from its predecessor for the most part that s fine with me having lived through the thin phone craze started by the motorola razr i m not aching for a slimmer device granted the 4s can feel bulky at times but i continue to enjoy its solid feel in the hand something that s not always there with skinny phones i don t have any problems with the handset s general aesthetics either a thinner phone may be prettier but it s what s inside that really counts the iphone 4s design is unchanged from the iphone 4 that s fine with us except that we d like a larger display i also can live without some of the rumored iphone 5 features like a wider home button and a curved profile the home button has never plagued me after all and i d prefer to rest the phone flat on a table and tap away the glass back continues to concern me a bit particularly after seeing a handful of iphone 4s fall to their doom that shouldn t be an issue if you have a case of course but speaking of which some iphone 4 cases will not fit on the iphone 4s because apple moved the ambient light sensor so if you re looking to dress your 4s make sure the case fits perfectly before buying and if you need suggestions executive editor david carnoy has a few my real design gripe is that the iphone s display is beginning to look rather small when compared with some of the android competition keep in mind that the iphone s screen has remained at 3.5 inches since the first edition appeared in 2007 at that time it was plenty big but as smartphone screens have crept above the 4-inch mark i now consider 3.5 inches the bare minimum size for a high-end device absolutely the retina display remains stunningly beautiful as do many super amoled screens but its size isn t always practical for in-car and hands-free use even worse it can get rather tiring watching a full-length film with the iphone perched on your airline seat tray table how much bigger would i want nothing too big--the 4.5-inch displays on some android models are a bit ridiculous--but something in the range of 3.75 inches or 4 inches would be a goldilocks just right i ll leave that up to the next iteration of the phone at the iphone 4s unveiling one of the biggest elephants in the room was whether the company would mention any differences to the antenna following the iphone 4 s antennagate yet when apple vp of marketing philip schiller took the stage he revealed that the iphone 4s has two antennas that it can choose between to find the best signal more on that later even if you can t see any changes on the outside it appears to fix what i found to be a very real problem you ll also see the same virtual keyboard basic features the 4s inherits all the standard iphone features from the preceding models including the calendar voice memos weather and stock apps the various clock features google maps the compass text messaging and e-mail and the notes app the ipod player is there as well the 4s splits your music and video libraries into two separate icons in another change the 4s also offers an upgrade to bluetooth 4.0 though still a growing technology bluetooth 4.0 uses less power and will enable the iphone to talk to small battery-operated devices like nike sensors and fitness machines at the gym for more on bluetooth 4.0 check out this deeper dive from nicole lee siri the feature that apple is touting most is the new voice assistant called siri it doesn t completely replace the current voice control feature--that s still there if you want it--but it certainly does a whole lot more basically siri both follows commands and answers your requests for information for example you can check the weather ask for a contact s address set up a reminder get directions and ask for obscure trivia you speak to a robotic female voice you can t change her identity and access the feature by holding down the home button just as you do to access voice control it uses both your location and a google search to find a response so you will need to have a wi-fi or cellular connection the feature is in beta mode and supports english french and german more languages will come later siri may just wind up being your best friend but be warned she has an attitude on my very first pass the day the 4s was announced i asked for the next day s weather the mileage between cupertino calif and seattle a reminder to book air tickets to chicago and the capital of canada it responded to most of my questions and commands quickly but it flaked on finding that ottawa is the capital of our neighbors to the north according to siri she didn t have enough information i m not sure why that was a problem for her siri uses wolfram alpha to check facts which has information on the canadian city on my next pass i tried asking the time in hong kong the current date where i could get the best burrito by the cnet office and if brian tong is the coolest person ever it answered the first two questions without any problems but poor siri didn t understand our question about brian and this time she did identify ottawa correctly i meant the question about brian as a joke of course but siri is quite adept at answering a range of queries when i asked about the best local burrito she used gps to give me a list of nearby taquerias with rankings yet not all questions for a preference turned up a good answer asking for the best camera for example just gave me a list of camera stores i m not being critical since the information siri delivered was useful--except for listing a japanese restaurant as a burrito joint--but it is worth noting on the other hand siri didn t hesitate to tell me the best cell phone on the market the one you are holding she replied yeah she can be a bit sassy i ve explored siri further in this post by all means siri is a fun and useful feature like with facetime on the 4s i got a big kick out of it around the office and i imagine that lots of other people will too over time i wonder just how much i d use it but features like this can surprise you i asked the same question about facetime and i ended up using that pretty frequently while traveling the challenge for apple will be to fully integrate hands-free technology you will be able to activate siri with a bluetooth headset no word on if you can do it with a wired headset but i understand that car integration is coming given the abundance of hands-free driving laws it s important that siri is fully accessible to drivers while they keep both hands on the wheel also it s important to note that even when your phone is locked with a passcode siri is usable without entering the code that means that anyone could use your phone to send a text message access your calendar or make a call you can disable this security flaw in the settings menu but bypassing the code is the default option camera the iphone 4 s 5-megapixel camera was already great--especially when you add a third party app--but the iphone 4s is significantly better the 8-megapixel camera offers autofocus flash f/2.4 aperture lens and a backside-illuminated cmos sensor that allows 73 percent more light than the previous sensor and should deliver better low-light performance a hybrid ir filter is also onboard for better color accuracy apple also claims the new camera performs 33 percent faster than the iphone 4 s camera and the a5 processor has a built-in image processor that adds face detection and 26 percent better auto white balance from the start i noticed a difference in image quality over the iphone 4 s camera colors were brighter and the focus was a little sharper with a bit less pixelation not surprisingly the camera also does better in low light though flash continues to be a little overpowering at times here s an in depth look at how the iphone 4s camera compares with the iphone 4 and for more photo fun senior editor lori grunin compared the iphone 4s to the canon powershot 100 hs the camera viewfinder now adds gridlines the user experience is almost the same from the tap-to-focus feature to the video toggle and the shutter control you will however notice a new options icon between the flash control and the button for switching between the cameras press it and you ll find both the hdr feature and an option for adding gridlines to the viewfinder thanks to ios 5 more on that later you also get new choices for cropping and rotating your shots red-eye reduction and a single-tap color correction option the red-eye reduction is a simple process that offered instantaneous and impressive results similarly the single-tap color correction tool balances your colors and in my tests did indeed make the image look better though i welcome these additions apple is way too late to the photo-editing party as this functionality has existed on basic phones for years i ll take what i can get but i d love even more user control the iphone 4s photo quality is very sharp the iphone 4 takes good photos too but you can see a difference ios 5 also adds several requested features to the camera app making it much more like a point-and-shoot camera you get a shortcut on the lock screen that will launch the camera immediately even bypassing the lock code a simple double-tap of the home button brings up both the basic music controls as before and the camera icon in the lower right you then can use the volume control to snap a photo the picture is saved to your camera roll but for security having not used your access code you ll only be able to delete the shot keeping unwanted users from browsing your iphone photos videos also get a boost with the ability to shoot 1080p hd video clips at 30 frames per second and with video stabilization videos continue to be sharp with fluid movements and sound that matches the action on the screen here s our standard studio shot with the 4s camera connectivity at amp t s 4s differs from the verizon and sprint versions in one major way while all three handsets have dual-mode cdma/gsm chips inside the cdma functionality on at amp t s handset has been deactivated though it s an unusual arrangement perhaps it was cost-saving measure it makes no difference to you since there s no need for an at amp t cell phone to even connect to a cdma network so both at home and abroad you ll use gsm just as you would on any other quad-band 850/900/8100/1900 world phone it s worth noting though that unlike sprint and verizon who ve promised to unlock the iphone 4s preloaded micro-sim card at amp t will limit international gsm roaming to its specific partners verizon s and sprint s iphones runs on each carrier s ev-do rev a 3g network which promise speeds of 600kbps to 1 400kbps and average upload speeds of 500kbps to 800kbps actual performance will depend on your location and the carrier s network capacity at a given time at amp t however is doing everything it can to boast that it has a faster hsdpa 14.4 network that s capable of reaching theoretical speeds of 14.4mbps down 5.8mbps up twice the speed of the iphone 4 if anyone is counting note however that at amp t has taken some liberties with its marketing by also saying its iphone 4s is compatible with even faster hspa speeds to really be classified as hspa its iphone 4s would technically need to be capable of reaching theoretical download speeds of 21mbps such as at amp t s samsung galaxy s ii at present apple s device isn t there yet the cdma models still won t permit simultaneous voice and data transmission that s a current limitation of the cdma technology see our verizon iphone 4 review for a more detailed explanation and though new chips are coming i m thinking they ll arrive in the next model so if you really need to be on the phone and surf the web at the same time then you should stick with at amp t continue to next page 1 2 editors top picks 1 htc one 4.0 stars 2 apple iphone 5 at amp t sprint

six models 16gb 32gb and 64gb in black or white the 16gb model starts at 199 with contract 649 without and each additional storage option bumps the price up by 100 the iphone 4s looks almost exactly like an iphone 4 99 4.5 stars the only way to tell them apart is in the fine print on the back sprint s new phone is model a1349 it s still a work of art an improbable black or white glass slab with a metal band around it cool and hard in the hand other phone-makers imitate but none of them have pared their phones down to this pure industrial solidity of course with the 4 s body come some of its flaws the glass front and back are prone to cracking if dropped frequently i ve seen more cracked iphones than any other variety of device and while apple considers the 3.5-inch retina display perfect and it s gorgeous i personally find the virtual keyboard too small to easily type on when it s in portrait layout apple has killed the death grip at least on the sprint model the phone switches between its top and bottom antennas depending on which one is receiving better signal which means it ll ignore whichever one you re covering with your hands i was able to get data speeds to drop by gripping the phone from both ends in a bizarre two-handed clench but really nobody uses a phone that way call quality on sprint s network through the phone s earpiece was excellent in my tests the earpiece goes loud there s a touch of side tone and i didn t hear any distortion at high volumes transmissions through the mic were sadly rather tinny but they were perfectly loud and the mic blocked background noise very well the speakerphone is fine for indoor use but not loud enough to use outdoors transmissions through the speakerphone were very clear rf reception was on par with the motorola photon 199 4.5 stars and other top sprint phones the iphone 4s paired easily with an aliph jawbone era bluetooth headset 129 4.5 stars and i found that by pressing the button on the headset i could issue an unusually wide range of voice commands see siri on the next page the bluetooth headset also worked for music sprint s iphone is a world phone which roams internationally for insanely high rates you can find at www.sprint.com/international there s a sim card in it which existing customers in good standing can request to be unlocked so they can replace it with a less-expensive alternative overseas sprint s phone will not work on verizon s or at amp t s networks here though the iphone 4s got 7 hours 33 minutes of 3g talk time that s considerably longer than the iphone 4 for verizon which got 6 hours 17 minutes and it delivers on apple s promise of longer battery life - as long as you have strong wireless signal internet and web browsingthe iphone 4s is strictly a 3g phone no 4g here and i m worried about the sprint network s ability to handle the strain on launch day all of my sprint phones were crawling along at a pathetic 300-500kbps with some data sessions taking several seconds to connect once i was connected i was connected i didn t drop calls or data sessions but it was like i was waiting in line to get on the internet sprint for its part says it didn t see any problems in new york city that day and we ve seen slow speeds on sprint before our annual fastest mobile networks tests rated sprint s 3g network as reliable but slower than at amp t s or verizon s but pour some data into this baby and wow it ll go as long as adobe flash isn t a key part of your life the iphone 4s is the fastest web phone ever it benchmarks faster than any android gingerbread phone and faster than any windows phone side by side against the motorola photon on the same wi-fi network the iphone 4s consistently loaded pages a few seconds faster the new version of android ice cream sandwich may even the score but we haven t seen or tested any ics phones yet the great browsing speed comes in part from the new ios 5 which we found made browsing much faster on all iphones it also comes in part from the new dual-core a5 processor the same one used in the ipad 2 there aren t a lot of third-party apps that take advantage of the dual-core processor and new gpu yet but it s key to some of the phone s best experiences such as the 1080p camera airplay video streaming to apple tv devices and the browser and remember that on sprint unlike every other iphone carrier you get truly unlimited cellular data right now that s a good deal for heavy users even if the data connection is slower than on other carriers there s one exception to the unlimited data policy tethering while the phone supports tethering and hotspot mode you need to pay 30 extra a month for them and you only get 5gb of data to use on your laptop or other device back to top 1 2

wrap-up comments down close if sbn.openx.istablet else the ipad mini has arrived and so has our review just last week apple introduced the world to the newest member of its wildly successful tablet line an adorable diminutive slate with a 7.9-inch display it even had an adorable ad to show along with it an ipad mini joining in with a full-sized ipad to play heart and soul on the piano but to think of the ipad mini as a companion to the 3rd or 4th generation ipad some kind of secondary player to the bigger version would probably be a mistake with a price tag starting at 329 and heading all the way up to 659 with lte and 64gb of storage this isn t really a step down from the existing ipad well the ipad 2 at least as much as it is a step to the side at least that s the impression i get want a big ipad that isn t too expensive get the 2nd gen one want one that you can throw in a bag or keep on the nightstand get the ipad mini you fly business class and work in photography let me point you in the direction of the new 4th generation model but regardless of market positioning the ipad mini has to be viewed in a world with a 199 nexus 7 or kindle fire hd two strong performers that are a far cry at least in price from the ipad mini even though apple might want consumers to see these as separate product categories consumers may only see that 129 gulf on the other hand apple has a lot to fill that gulf including the absolute best software ecosystem for tablets on the planet right now but is the ipad mini worth the stretch or would you be smarter to save the cash and saddle up to another device quote.ipad video review video review hardware hardware and design hands-on with the ipad mini previous next view full gallery previous next jdocument.readyfunction j gallery3342045 .gallery moments after i held the ipad mini at apple s event in san jose i hurriedly wrote that it made other tablets in this class feel like toys perhaps i was a bit hard on the competition in the heat of the moment but i will say that there isn t a single product in the 7-inch tablet market that comes close to the look feel or build quality of the new ipad it is absolutely gorgeous to see and in your hand has the reassuring solidness of a product that s built to last if the iphone 5 is reminiscent of jewelry the ipad mini is like a solidly made watch in fact the iphone 5 and the mini have a lot in common they both share a metal housing in silver or black that s lean and smooth with that reflective chamfered edge that runs around the border of the display the ipad mini s paint job is similar to the iphone s but smoother and on the black version i tested has a glint of blue and purple to it in certain light it looks dangerous and it feels great it looks dangerous and it feels great the ipad mini s design stands above the competition all of the standard ipad button and switch placement is intact here save for the move of the speaker grille to the bottom of the device it s been around back for ipads previous to this version along with the new lightning port and that s a good-sounding set of stereo speakers by the way you ll find separate volume buttons on the right side beneath the mute / rotation lock toggle and the power / sleep button on the top just as expected the front of the device is all glass save for an hd camera in the center of the top bezel as you hold it in portrait and the home button on the bottom there s also a 5-megapixel camera on the back though the ipad mini sports a slightly larger display than other devices in this class its profile feels extremely lean sometimes too lean the device weighs just 0.68 pounds and it s only 0.28 inches thick noticeably thinner than the nexus 7 s 0.41 inches or fire hd s 0.4 inches i actually had a little trouble holding onto the device when i wasn t using the smart cover due to the back being as smooth as it is and the frame being so thin maybe it s just my big hands but i wanted a little more to grab onto in that regard i prefer the feel of the nexus 7 that problem was exacerbated by how wide the device feels in your hand as well as the lack of a significant bezel around the left and right of the screen in portrait maybe it s just old habit but i didn t feel completely comfortable putting my thumb over the screen itself apple has apparently included some new palm rejection logic in the ipad mini s version of ios which wards off unwanted touches and it did seem to work it may have caused other issues however which i ll touch on in the software section minor quibbles aside the ipad mini stands head and shoulders above the competition in terms of design the caliber of its components and the solidness of how it s been built but it also has another quality one that s nearly as important the device has personality i ve started to think of it as a constant companion small enough to throw in a bag or carry around the house there s something endearing about the mini that makes you want to keep it on-hand and use it often it s a feeling the larger ipad never elicited in me specs and cameras specs and cameras inside the mini you ll find specs essentially identical to the ipad 2 save for a few alterations the system is built atop the two-generations-old a5 cpu appears to sport a dangerously tiny 512mb of ram and ships in 16gb 32gb and 64gb storage capacities i tested the 64gb wi-fi-only version all the requisite radios are here too wi-fi 802.11a/b/g/n 2.4ghz and 5ghz bluetooth 4.0 and eventually you ll be able to buy a version with cdma gsm and lte cellular options as you would expect a light sensor accelerometer and gyroscope are here as well it really is a mini version of the ipad 2 except for the cameras which are significantly improved as you may know i m not a fan of people taking photos with tablets just as with previous models i ve tested i find the act to be not only awkward but embarrassing as well the slightly more diminutive size of the ipad mini does make the experience slightly better and its 5 megapixel backside camera is actually not terrible for general shots in fact its color tone and low light performance was better than what i ve seen on many newer smartphones it was sometimes difficult to get a clean image due to shakiness but that has more to do with the odd physicality of taking a photo with a tablet than it does with the actual camera the front-facing facetime hd camera is fine for video chatting and i think is a lot more comfortable than chatting with the full size ipad but won t be useful for anything more than that low light performance was better than what i ve seen on many smartphones display display there s no question that the screen does look lower-res much has been made about the display on the ipad mini the ips screen measures 7.9 inches diagonally and is 1024 x 768 in resolution for those keeping count it s the same resolution as the original ipad that makes for a pixel density of 163 ppi which as you might guess doesn t seem too terrific next to devices like the nexus 7 or kindle fire hd each 216 ppi nook color hd 243 ppi or the big daddy 4th generation ipad 264 ppi it s also much lower in pixel density than pretty much any smartphone on the market right now but how does it look well for starters it s a really good looking display in general terms apple is using the same treatment here as it does on the iphone 5 and ipad and it makes for a crystal-clear screen that seems to hover just a tiny bit beneath glass colors are vibrant and blacks are deep and games photos and video look terrific that s only half the story however there s no question that to the naked eye this screen does look lower in resolution than its nearest competition pixels are noticeable especially in webpages books and when viewing email and that can be distracting sometimes since apple is the company that s gotten our eyes used to the hey-look-no-pixels trick of the retina display it s hard to take a step back and not notice i don t think the lower resolution is a deal-breaker in this product but it is a compromise you have to be aware of it simply doesn t look as clear as other products on the market software battery software performance battery its app selection is an embarrassment of riches the biggest change in the software on the ipad mini that you need to be aware of is.. everything is smaller 99 out of 100 times while using it this wasn t an issue but it did take some getting used to in places for instance because the screen real estate is so much larger than an iphone but icons are now roughly iphone size apps with lots of navigational elements can be a little less intuitive to navigate furthermore the keyboard size feels altered most notably in portrait and the keys don t seem tall enough for my fingers on the other hand the mini makes landscape typing a lot easier supposedly the software on the mini has been tweaked to reject unwanted touches on the sides of the display and during my testing it did seem to keep my thumb from making accidental moves in apps the flip side to that however is that it sometimes seems to overcompensate and reject touches you intended meaning that sometimes apps don t respond the way you want it wasn t a huge problem but it could be annoying at times so i hope that apple makes some effort to fine-tune this in future updates other than that ios on the ipad mini is exactly the same as the software on a regular ipad that s it the end fin i m not going to go into great detail about ios 6 since we ve already seen it on other products and in fact have a review of it right here what i will say is that the fact that it is for all intents and purposes a regular ipad makes it easily the most attractive tablet in this size range when it comes to software it s easy to become used to how vast and impressive the library is for the ipad but using the mini reminded me of just how right apple got this part of their ecosystem compared to the nexus 7 or the fire hd.. well there is no comparison the ipad s app selection is an embarrassment of riches and using apps like the powerful paper or garageband or playing games like the incredibly fun punchquest or letterpress really makes a tremendous case for why a consumer might spend that extra 129 performance on the device was expectedly snappy i didn t see any weirdness stuttering or lag that would cause alarm though some heavier apps and games took noticeably longer to load up than they do on the new 4th generation or even 3rd generation ipad i think for the time being the mini can handle what developers are throwing at it just fine but i do have my concerns about the shelf life of this product considering how much older its internals are given apple s habit of rapid-fire obsolescing of products your timeline for the mini may be shorter than you expect battery life was not surprisingly everything apple claimed it would be on the tablets more than on any other product the company makes it seems to be hitting its targets on longevity i spent some pretty heavy days in mixed use intermittent sessions of email web browsing twitter irc game playing music and video playback and didn t have to worry about charging until about the middle or evening the next day overall i was more than satisfied with the ipad mini s battery performance i didn t have to worry about charging lte model lte model adding cellular connectivity to a small tablet feels like a no-brainer hardware-wise the lte version of the ipad mini is virtually identical to the wi-fi-only version the only real difference is the black bar on the top rear battery life has been nearly identical as well though if you re using a lot of cellular data you re probably more likely to see a dip we tested the verizon version of the ipad mini averaging download and upload speeds of around 8mbps each those speeds are more a testament to the fact that verizon s lte network has slowed slightly thanks to the iphone 5 than to the ipad s capabilities adding cellular connectivity to a small tablet feels like a no-brainer moreso than it does on a full-size 10-inch tablet you re much more likely to be toting it around with you in places without wi-fi coverage and it s a real boon to just have data simply available when you do if you frequently tether the ipad mini makes a lot of sense too ios 6 is simply rock-solid when tethering via usb and the ipad mini lasts forever as a wi-fi hotspot though there are still some issues getting the initial connection going with ios the 130 price premium for an lte version is a bit steep especially compared to the 50 premium on the nexus 7 mobile but if you have

distillation of everything that makes the ipad the top-selling -- and best -- tablet available today however you regard the ipad mini it is one of those rare products greater than the sum of its parts in fact the mini s super light diminutive body high quality construction industry-leading app ecosystem ten hour battery life and worthy performance actually make this our favorite ipad to date even despite bearing a lower overall gdgt score than its 10-inch sibling however it is by no means perfect and there are trade offs to consider most glaringly its vivid beautiful display is sadly far lower resolution than its competition -- not to mention the myriad other apple products featuring retina displays it simply doesn t look as crisp as other devices don t be surprised if the ipad mini 2 eventually fixes this chief deficiency and while its 329 price tag means it isn t the best bang for the buck among small tablets -- that award still goes to the outrageously low-priced and unprofitable 199 nexus 7 -- make no mistake the ipad mini is easy to love and very much worth every penny '),(368,'2012-10-30 00:00:00',8.3,70,' slide 2 slide 3 slide 4 slide 5 slide 6 slide 7 slide 8

apple s long-awaited and finally real tinier tablet is remarkably thinner and lighter than its big-boned newly arrived fourth-gen ipad sibling but it also starts at 329 a price that s well above the bargain-basement 199 target floated by devices like the nexus 7 amazon kindle fire hd and nook hd certainly the tablet playing field -- especially when it comes to media -- is leveling the kindle s book video and app ecosystem is impressive in its own right the nook has made gains with its apps and services android has google play regardless none of these can truly compare to the breadth of content from apple s app store and itunes the app store is apple s great gold mine and the ipad mini s price seems to be banking on you knowing that and in that sense the ipad mini may be worth its price but the original ipad hit a sweet-spot 499 price that few competitors could match the mini s price is about 130 higher than many similar 7-inch tablets that undercut it it s even more expensive than some newly arriving 8.9-inch tablets from amazon and barnes amp noble credit cnet the ipad mini is really a shrunken-down ipad 2 or a larger ipod touch the original ipad was a larger ipod touch too in a lot of ways that didn t make it any less appealing here the tablet is not intended to be a laptop alternative -- it s a kindle alternative this is a compact reader/viewer of documents magazines movies games maybe even for editing or creating and it s spectacular at being portable credit sarah tew/cnet what s unique about the mini without a doubt it s the design it s cute it s discreet and it s very very light it feels like a whole new device for apple it s light enough to hold in one hand something that wasn t really true of the ipad if held for extended periods of time it s bedroom-cozy other full-fledged 7-inch tablets feel heavier and bulging by comparison credit sarah tew/cnet this is a new standard for little-tablet design it makes the ipad feel fresh after a week of using the ipad mini it seems to find a way to follow me everywhere it s extremely addictive and fun to use but oh that screen it s not bad not at all but it s not a retina display it s not even as high-res as screens on other 7-inch tablets if you re obsessive about crisp text you ll notice the fuzziness if you re comparing the mini with a laptop you won t i wanted that display to be as good as the one on the iphone 5 ipod touch and retina ipad it isn t not now it mars the product for me because otherwise the screen size and its aspect ratio are perfect for handling comics magazines and reading apps credit josh miller/cnet is the ipad mini worth its premium at nearly 130 more than some of the competition if you re looking to get an ipad for the least amount of money the answer is yes if you re investing in ios-land for the first time this is a very good starting point a retina display and a lower price would have made the ipad mini perfect the fourth-gen ipad in contrast is a superior device under the hood with much faster performance and a better-quality screen still for many people the mini will be preferable because it s less expensive and perfectly portable for others it ll be the second ipad -- the kid ipad the beach ipad i love this ipad i m just not sure i need to own it editors note updated on november 30 with an added section after testing the lte version of the mini design regardless of your feelings about the mini s price or its a5 processor and non-retina 7.9-inch display here s what you ll notice when you pick it up it s really shockingly nice to hold credit cnet the ipad mini is a design shift from the ipad and perhaps the biggest one in the ipad s entire history despite how popular the ipad s been it s not really a device that s very comfortable to use when you re not sitting down or at a desk it s a use-when-you-get-there device or use-when-comfortably-seated an iphone or ipod touch is truly mobile and the ipad is only halfway there credit sarah tew/cnet that s not the case for the mini the ipad mini is an extremely easy-to-hold tablet that despite its wider form feels as light as a kindle not a kindle fire but a kindle at 0.28 inch thin and 0.68 pound 0.69 for the lte versions it s the slimmest and lightest 7-inch-range tablet around although it has a larger footprint 7.87 inches by 5.3 inches it s thinner than an iphone 5 and seems proportionally as razor-thin as the new ipod touch credit cnet in fact the ipad mini feels very much like the new touch even down to the curved wraparound aluminum shell and flat back it lies down far more flatly than the fourth-gen ipad more like a wafer the headphone jack at the top and lightning connector and speakers at the bottom are carved into less tapered more curved side edges around the front glass is an angled aluminum bezel like on the iphone 5 credit josh miller/cnet the white model which i reviewed has a standard aluminum back the black model has a slate-colored anodized aluminum giving it that same stealth look as the ipod touch fourth-gen ipad ipad mini ipod touch credit cnet the ipad mini s extremely whittled-down side bezels are much less conspicuous than the larger ipad s bezels which always made it resemble a macbook screen that had floated away from its keyboard the mini truly feels like a large ipod touch which is exactly what we used to call the ipad back in 2010 it s far more apt now credit scott stein/cnet you probably won t think that though because the ipad mini won t easily fit in your pocket or even your jacket pocket it s more of a purse small bag or large-coat-pocket device it ll fit wherever you d fit a softcover book the construction feels solid stellar fun to hold the home button clicks crisply it doesn t feel like a lower-priced product in your hands it might be in terms of form the most addictive ios product in existence and it s perfectly sized for kid hands it s far more suited for use in cars and traveling credit cnet but the mini shouldn t be a surprising product a device smaller than the ipad that can run apps that s always existed that s called the iphone the really impressive feat of the ipad mini the surprise is that it seems to handle all the ipad s normal duties while being shrunken down all except effortless onscreen typing although it comes close gripping swiping and typing thumbs and fingers so what about that smaller bezel holding it suddenly becomes a delicate-seeming proposition i worried i d accidentally start an app with my big palms or turn a page by accident that didn t happen to me apple has worked finger-rejection technology into the hardware and software of the ipad mini that s context-dependent all i know is that when reading books on the kindle app or ibooks i found holding on the side wasn t a problem when i typed the entire edge-to-edge surface became sensitive to my entire hand credit cnet in landscape mode the longer and thicker top and bottom bezel come in handy it offers more of a grip when viewing videos and i found that it also helped make the ipad mni comfier when playing games the tweener size of the mini means you can hold it in portrait mode and thumb-type like on an iphone or ipod it works pretty well for the most part i was even able to thumb-type in landscape mode with a little stretching typing more traditionally works better than i expected although i became more of a finger hunt-and-pecker than a spread-finger typist the 7.9-inch display certainly isn t as wide as the average laptop keyboard and the virtual keys while well-sized require a bit of adjustment to use you can also hold the ipad mini in one hand and thumb-swipe but i wouldn t recommend it it s not as intuitive as on an iphone although it could be fine for simple page-turning taps the screen retina-free your feelings about the ipad mini s screen will all depend on how much time you ve spent with retina displays or high-pixel-count devices if you own a recent iphone or the last ipad you ll feel that this screen is blurry text isn t as sharp the pixels per inch don t even match what s available on a kindle fire hd or nook hd the ipad mini has a 1 024x768-pixel display just like the ipad 2 s but writ smaller with a denser pixel count per inch however the smaller-screened kindle fire hd has a 1 280x800-pixel display so does the google nexus 7 the nook hd has an even higher-res display at 1 440x900 pixels the nexus 7 ipad mini nook hd and kindle fire hd credit josh miller/cnet all three cost considerably less than the ipad mini and all three have much higher denser pixel counts the ipad mini s 7.9-inch screen has more physical real estate in terms of square inches let s just call it an 8-inch screen because it very nearly is but fewer pixels per inch you re trading size for high-res crispness so the ipad mini not only has a lower-resolution screen than much of the competition but it s probably the least impressive screen of apple s 2012 stable of ios devices the ipod touch iphone 5 and fourth-gen ipad all seem brighter more vibrant and far higher-definition credit sarah tew/cnet however if you ve used an ipad 2 the text is crisper it s readable even with smaller fonts such as those used in e-mail with games and videos you won t notice quite as much because graphics and videos are often in constant motion even there though i could see a clear difference playing hd videos and a variety of games the ips display has excellent wide-angle viewing and it s very bright it may not be as good as a retina display but it s every bit as good as the ipad 2 s screen i held both up side by side and found the colors and vibrancy to be similar although the ipad mini is less bright at its highest setting in deeper in-depth tests using cnet s tv-testing equipment the ipad mini s display was revealed to indeed be less bright at its highest setting but also less color-accurate than the nearly-perfect retina displays on the iphone 5 and third and fourth-gen ipads when looking at photos or movies you can definitely tell the difference side-by-side even if for all the incredible design that the ipad mini has going for it otherwise that screen feels like a comparative letdown there s big ace in the ipad mini s hole a huge one actually it has to do with aspect ratio this 7.9-inch display isn t 16 9 like the iphone 5 or most android tablets that means the screen width is wider more like a page of a book it s the same as on the ipad but on this smaller screen with the ipad mini s shrunken-down side bezels like an ipod touch it feels extra-wide web pages fit more across the screen allowing the text to be bigger more importantly digital magazines and illustrated books can be rendered without squishing down too much apple s made a big deal of this but let me tell you the real killer apps here the future of digital publications textbooks basically any layout-sensitive graphically intensive e-books the ipad mini doesn t squish that content down like what often happens to it on 16 10 7-inch screens an ibooks version of dk publishing s dinosaurs looked wonderful and engaging so did the kids book/app bobo explores light credit cnet maybe most impressively nearly every larger ipad app i ve thrown at it feels usable and comfortable at this smaller screen size board games with tiny buttons media-editing apps games with virtual control pads and even using the onscreen virtual keyboard it s book-size but the apps feel largely the same ipad mini as e-reader you could be of two minds about this yes the non-retina display means text that s less sharp it feels like a miscalculation on a device so clearly targeted at reading yet hold the ipad mini back a foot and increase the font size and you probably won t notice credit cnet the more booklike 4 3 aspect ratio and its more natural compatibility with pdf files comics magazines and layout-sensitive graphic novels give the ipad mini an edge over other 7-inch tablets for pure text the mini may not be the best for other media it has its advantages even without a retina display i never found myself unable to enjoy a magazine or book although i did find myself wishing the resolution were sharper reading the dark knight returns comic in particular one big advantage of the ipad mini with ios it s compatible with all the big services kindle nook google books it s the closest to a universal e-book reader credit sarah tew/cnet ipad mini as video player that 4 3 aspect ratio has a drawback of course and that s video playing movies and hd tv shows will inevitably be more letterboxed than on a 16 9 tablet like the nexus 7 and kindle fire hd on a retina display ipad you at least have enough pixels to make for sharp video viewing in the

featuresat 7.87 by 5.30 by .28 inches hwd the mini is the slimmest tablet i ve ever tested and at 10.9 ounces it s an ounce lighter than the nexus 7 the front is a glass screen surrounded by a very narrow black or white bezel with apple s signature home button below it as always apple s volume controls home button and mute/screen lock rotation switch are perfectly placed and easy to find the headphone jack lives in the left corner of the top panel with apple s new compact lightning port on the center of the bottom edge view all 21 photos in gallery the back is wraparound black or silver for the white model aluminum with the 5-megapixel camera up in the corner the fit and finish make every other tablet look amateurish and the body is beautifully rigid and flex-free the metal back sure is beautiful but it s an ergonomic mistake it s too slippery with a tablet you re supposed to be using with a single hand you want a slightly grippy material on the back panel so you have something to grab while the ipad mini is comfortable to hold because it s so light its width puts its center of gravity further from your palm than with narrower tablets and i kept feeling like it was almost about to slip out of my hand for me the problem was made worse by the grip i had to hold it in because the mini is just too wide for me to wrap my hand around everyone s hands are different but i found the mini s 5.3-inch width is a real thumb-stretcher it compared poorly with the nexus 7 whose 4.7-inch width is easily grippable especially when combined with the smaller tablet s textured back unlike the nexus i couldn t fit the mini into my back pocket and it s a snug fit in a jacket pocket i know others have called this a one-handed tablet but i m not finding it so apple dodged another potential ergonomic bullet though the narrow bezel made me worry about accidental touches but i didn t run into that problem apple has thumb-detection technology which in my tests successfully ignored my thumb on the edge of the screen the screenthe ipad mini s 7.9-inch 1 024-by-768 ips lcd screen doesn t look low-res on its own although you can definitely see the difference next to a 4th-generation ipad with retina display a kindle fire hd or a nook hd but the display here is sharper than the ipad 2 s screen since it s smaller colors are richer and the screen is brighter than on the nexus 7 although neither the color depth nor brightness measures up to the kindle fire hd and nook hd displays another thing to consider if you ve gotten used to reading text on a retina display text will look horribly low-res here the display is also quite reflective and i found that very noticeable dr raymond soneira of displaymate technologies found it noticeable too noting in his display technology shoot-out that the mini reflects 53 percent more ambient light than the nexus 7 and 41 percent more than the kindle fire hd since the screen is larger than competing 7-inch tablets keys on the on-screen keyboard are a little larger too but apple s claim of having greater real estate than competitors is belied by the tablet s lower resolution you see a little bit less of a web page at a time on the mini than on the nexus 7 and noticeably less than on the kindle fire on the pcmag.com home page for instance the nexus 7 displays about 75 percent of the total height while the ipad mini s display ends about three lines of text above the kindle with its even sharper screen shows two more lines of text below the nexus 7 s range the nexus 7 fits more icons on a home screen 42 versus 24 on the mini small type looks sharper on the other two tablets as well the larger screen also doesn t confer much advantage when watching wide-screen movies you just get huge black bars above and below them i rented the hunger games in hd from apple amazon and google play apple s encoding was the sharpest but the video looked about the same size on the nexus 7 and kindle fire much of apple s increased screen area was wasted by larger letterboxing bars thanks to the boxy 4 3 screen aspect ratio the nexus 7 s 16 10 screen displayed the movie better performance and battery lifethe ipad mini shares the ipad 2 s 1ghz dual-core apple a5 processor and screen resolution and delivers roughly the same performance we test ios devices with the browsermark sunspider guimark glbenchmark and geekbench benchmarks the ipad 2 the third-generation ipad and ipad mini all offer similar performance a little faster than the iphone 4s and the new ipod touch but noticeably slower than the new fourth-generation ipad and the iphone 5 since ios is a hugely popular platform though apps are generally written to work well on the a5 and you don t see a lot of slowdowns need for speed most wanted for instance played just fine on the mini the only hiccup i could see was in zooming the barefoot world atlas app which was a bit jerky on the mini but smoother on the fourth-gen ipad accelerometer-based games work especially well here because the mini is such a small light tablet it s much easier to tilt and control the mini than with a larger ipad web browsing performance beats competing seven-inch tablets part of that is thanks to the mini s faster 5ghz 802.11n wi-fi with channel bonding which will probably max out your home connection on a fast corporate link using the ookla speedtest.net app i got an average of 36mbps down as compared with about 7mbps on a kindle fire hd and 7.6mbps on a nexus 7 the low result from the kfhd really surprised me as it s supposed to have the same faster wi-fi as the ipad mini that translates into much faster app downloads updates and less buffering for streaming video the mini was also the fastest web browser although not by much my basket of web sites loaded in an average of 5 seconds each on the mini as compared with 7.1 seconds on the nexus 7 and 10.3 on the kindle fire hd while the model we tested was wi-fi-only the mini

apple ceo tim cook introduced two new ipads one the ipad mini is a legitimately new product the other was a small upgrade to the 9.7-inch ipad bringing a new processor and new lightning port to the device but tim cook didn t just call the latest ipad a minor iterative upgrade or a poorly-disguised excuse to get a lightning port on the tablet he called it the fourth generation of ipad cook touted faster performance thanks to a new a6x processor with no hit to the ipad s battery life and yes there s a lightning port the refresh comes at a very odd time only a few months after apple unveiled the new ipad it s now the old ipad but is the new new ipad worth envying or upgrading for quote.ipad video review video review note this is our video review of the third-generation ipad from back in march everything s still the same except the processor s a little better and there s now a lightning connector the new new ipad the new new ipad the answer s pretty simple actually it will be better but for now it s more or less the same the basics of the device haven t changed at all so read our review from march for the full skinny on the 2012 ipad the 1.3-pound ipad s 2048 x 1536 retina display is still among the best we ve seen on a tablet i d say the best but the nexus 10 s display is also pretty great the new device is comfortable to hold incredibly well-constructed and best of all offers access to the 275 000-plus tablet-optimized apps in apple s app store it comes in wi-fi and lte-enabled flavors the latest version brings lte models to more carriers including sprint and starts at 499 as always the camera is solid though you absolutely shouldn t be taking pictures with your ipad you ll almost never notice the difference between this ipad and the last version unless you look at the bottom of the tablet the lightning connector is the one and only aesthetic change between third- and fourth-generation ipads the new connector means that any docks cables or accessories you had for your ipad are now useless without a 29 adapter that s currently all but impossible to find anywhere but lightning s clearly the future for apple s products and thus its ecosystem so there s good reason both for apple to rush out a lightning-enabled ipad as quickly as possible and for you to get an ipad with a lightning connector apple release a couple of new lightning accessories at the event which help bring it up to parity with what s available for the 30-pin connector at least from a first-party perspective there s now an sd card adapter so you can plug your camera s memory card straight into your ipad along with the new lightning to usb adapter it replaces the old 30-pin camera connection kit the new accessories work just as you d expect and i really do like using the ipad as the hub for a lot of my photos apple ipad pictures 4th generation previous next view full gallery previous next jdocument.readyfunction j gallery3336801 .gallery the lightning connector doesn t change much about how you ll actually use your ipad but the new a6x processor might at its launch event apple svp phil schiller said the a6x offers double the cpu and graphics performance of the a5x which powers the third-gen ipad the competition wasn t even close to us schiller boasted and now we re just blowing past them some more in practice the most noticeable difference between third and fourth generation of ipad is how quickly apps launch it s not so much that the older ipad is slow to launch apps but the a6x-powered model is consistently and noticeably faster to do so light apps like notes or mail launch only a beat faster but games and movies were often several seconds faster to open on the new model it makes for a much smoother experience instapaper used to show an empty shelf for a second or two before populating and now pops to fully stocked life almost instantly the browser s also a little faster both to launch and to load pages apple has touted improved wi-fi performance on the new ipad which could also be contributing either way the browser performance is better than ever though it s not an earth-shattering improvement the upgraded facetime camera is definitely better as well the picture s noticeably sharper especially in small details like eyes and teeth but it s only good on the spectrum of integrated webcams it s a better video chat experience but still useless for pretty much everything else to look at the ipad almost nothing has changed that s a welcome change but the biggest bump will come when developers write apps taking full advantage of the a6x s computational and graphical abilities but it s hard to say when that will be games can t really be optimized for the new chip when there are so many older ipads out there and when the brand-new ipad mini only has an a5 processor inside so for the most part performance isn t noticeably better from the last ipad to the new one the difference between a5x and a6x will only become bigger over timei spent many hours playing dead space infinity blade 2 and zomebiewood and the performance was near-perfect graphics are smooth no matter how detailed everything s incredibly responsive and i saw nary a skipped frame or stuttery animaton of course i could say all those same things about the ipad that came out in march the newest ipad is better but only if you re really picky and really paying attention even as the ipad gets more powerful new processors lte connectivity its reported battery life stays the same and so too do our test results i got almost exactly nine hours of continuous wi-fi browsing on the verge battery test which cycles through popular websites and high-res images with the brightness set to 65 percent i didn t have an lte model to test the battery there but i bet it equals the last model the more things change the more they stay the same i have no reason to doubt cook and schiller when they say the a6x is a better chip that it puts the ipad s performance even further ahead of its competition but at least for now it doesn t seem to be enough of an upgrade over apple s own previous efforts to be worth running out to sell the ipad you bought only a few weeks or months ago and if you ve had your ipad for a while you might be better off living in the ignorance-is-bliss world of the 30-pin ecosystem staving off the extinction of all your docks and chargers wrap-up compare it apple ipad 4th generation wi-fi 9.3 verge score 8.7 user score write review good stuff display is still best-in-class apps launch faster and smoother than ever app ecosystem is unrivaled bad stuff ios is lacking some features lightning ecosystem is relatively small still pricey with lte a definite upgrade but if you bought the last one you ll be just fine the fourth-generation ipad is the very definition of an iterative change apple made important things better but neither overhauled nor revolutionized anything if the ipad s history is any indication the fourth-generation ipad s advantages over the third-gen model will be most apparent two years from now when apps are designed for the better processor and the lightning connector has spawned a much larger universe of accessories then you ll want the extra power and the adapter-free lifestyle for now if you re within your return window you should probably swap for the newest ipad

it beats every other tablet on the market right now except google s nexus 10 which offers a 300ppi 2 560-by-1 600 10-inch screen but both web browsing and gaming look better on the ipad s screen

longer than the nexus 10 which clocked in at just over 5 hours on the same test i ll retest at half brightness as well with the third-gen ipad halving the brightness bumped video playback time up to

software for this device in the eight months since the third-generation ipad was released most of the apps i have been using for testing have been upgraded to retina versions the os smoothes and improves standard elements within many non-retina-enhanced apps too including text and embedded maps speaking of those maps apple s troubles with mapping don t affect this ipad as much as other ios devices because the wi-fi-only model lacks gps still though if it can find wi-fi the tablet can find its location and you can download a third-party mapping app if you like here are 10 solid apple maps alternatives the latest ipad packs an apple a6x processor which geekbench reports to be running at 1.4ghz apple won t confirm or deny the custom-designed a6 as seen in the iphone 5 was already one of the fastest cpus available the a6x enhances the a6 with even better graphics the results are stunning the fourth-gen ipad outmatched all other apple products on the geekbench and glbenchmark

loading pages i saw delays and stutters in the nexus 10 s interface that i never saw on the ipad updating a large number of apps went more slowly on the nexus than on the ipad and under heavy strain

ipad with its retina display has suddenly become the recipient of a surprising seventh-month upgrade to a very similar-looking device now known as the fourth-generation ipad should owners of the now old third-gen march 2012 ipad be upset should new buyers be wary the answer to the first is yes the answer to the second is no the new ipad technically just known as ipad at the apple store has a few

fourth-gen ipad with retina display subtly different pictures 1-2 of 7 scroll left scroll right biggest of all is the new processor lurking beneath an a6x processor replacing the third-gen s a5x the previous ipad was no slouch in the performance department but as we remarked when we reviewed the ipad in march its speed gains weren t such a huge quantum leap compared with what we got from the ipad 2 the a6x speeds up the ipad back to levels you d expect and it handles retina display graphics even better this is the ipad 3s so to speak considering that the ipad still has the same price as before starting at 499 for 16gb it s an even better buy than it was seven months ago the landscape s changed a little bit since march competing tablets have become more affordable windows 8 and rt tablets now offer an alternative set of products none of these can touch the ipad the biggest competitor really is that innocent ipad mini which could be the biggest little disruptor of them all especially when it gets its own retina display you may be concerned to buy this ipad could apple surprise us with more frequent updates instead of yearly cycles i think that s unlikely plus the important point is that this ipad is the best one it s polished it s improved over the third-gen model if you were on the fence about buying one before now s the time to go ahead and do it and it s still a better

fourth-gen ipad on a table anywhere and no one will be able to know it s the latest and greatest unless he happens to see that telltale teeny-tiny lightning connector this isn t a product you can easily show off just like the iphone 4s it has the same weight size and overall design as its predecessor even the back panel doesn t give any hint that this is a newer ipad than before for a deeper dive on what this ipad feels like go back and read donald bell s review of the third-gen ipad credit cnet my wi-fi review model came in black 64gb the ipad also comes in white both as usual have differently colored front glass and the same aluminum backs does the ipad s design still hold up yes mainly because of its all-metal-and-glass construction still a rarity among tablets the 1.4-pound body doesn t feel lightweight but it s comfortable to hold in two hands as a one-handed device it s awkward and cumbersome the sleek feel makes it seem fragile indeed you wouldn t want to drop one on a hard floor credit cnet the retina display also remains the same and it s still as lovely as ever the 2 048x1 536-pixel 9.7-inch ips screen is unmatched among tablets color accuracy is superb movies look great and photos look even better text is crystal-clear just like on the iphone it makes a big difference when looking at web pages still this is all exactly the same as the third-gen ipad the thicker bezel of the ipad is necessary at this size and weight it helps keep a grip on the otherwise ultra-sleek body the single home button still feels a little vestigial but it s not going anywhere

amp a wrap-up comments down close if sbn.openx.istablet else the moment tim cook took the stage and announced the new ipad on march 7th in san francisco i immediately started brainstorming on my review for the device there are clear challenges in comparing generational iterative products like the ipad especially when the devices themselves look nearly identical looks of course are really only half the story with the new ipad side note the name is just ipad though apple seems to be using new quite liberally in fact looks may not be the story at all while the device does appear to be physically nearly identical to its predecessor there are significant changes in the product for starters it s boasting that outrageous retina display its 9.7-inch screen delivering a whopping 2048 x 1536 resolution the new ipad is also equipped with a greatly improved camera on its back a 5 megapixel shooter not unlike the one featured on the iphone 4 new 4g lte options for both verizon and at

fallout after the introduction of the last iphone there were questions why does it look the same no quad-core processor has apple lost its edge yet despite the questions pre-orders seem to be record breaking just as with the iphone 4s but is the ipad as good as it needs to be has apple made the right moves or is it slipping behind the competition most importantly does the new ipad successfully defend the last version s reputation as the king of tablets i ll answer all those questions and more in this review so read on video review video review hardware hardware and design the ipad remains best in breed when it comes to design ipad review hardware hands-on previous next view full gallery previous next jdocument.readyfunction j gallery2636192 .gallery as i said in the opening there isn t much to note physically about the new ipad in terms of materials general design and even packaging this device is essentially the same product as the ipad 2 sure it s a slight bit thicker 0.37 inches compared to the previous version s 0.34 and yes it s somewhat heavier 1.34 pounds versus 1.46 pounds for the cell-equipped versions but that s about it from the glass-covered display to the machined aluminum backing this is basically the same device you ve seen since march of 2011 admittedly you can tell that it s got a bit more heft when you re holding it for long periods but it s so minor it seems unlikely that only the most particular and whiny critics will really have an issue 50 years from now the ipad won t look out of placethe question now is does this thing look dated let s be honest here the original ipad and the ipad 2 weren t dramatically different looking and there s even less of a step between the ipad 2 and the new model that said there s little to fault in this design everything is pretty much where it should be and functions as it should for a tablet device where the display is the only substantial method of input available you need little more than a screen and that s what the ipad provides much like the classic dieter rams braun products most modern apple devices are aping one feels that 50 years ago or 50 years from now this product won t look too out of place in the world of industrial design that s a rarity i will however take a moment to gripe about two hardware decisions that have bugged me from the start the first is the placement of the headphone jack i m sure there are many reasons why apple chose to put the 3.5mm port in the upper left-hand corner of the device in portrait / lower left-hand corner in landscape but i feel like it would make a lot more sense on the bottom of the device secondly it would be nice to be able to dock the ipad in landscape mode but that would require a second 30-pin dock connection on the side of the tablet i reported long ago that a version of the ipad which functioned like that was in play at some point at apple and i wish they d kept it around minor gripes aside the ipad remains best in breed when it comes to design and materials other tablets may have more ports or larger screens but few can match the elegance sleekness or solidness of this device internals internals specs do matter it seems and the new ipad delivers a substantial upgrade in nearly every department inside the ipad isn t playing around either the system-on-a-chip which the previous ipad used the a5 has been retooled and spun into something apple calls the a5x at the center of that chip is an arm-based dual core soc clocked to 1ghz along with a quad-core gpu apple has upgraded the ram in the ipad from 512mb to a full 1gb and you ll find bluetooth 4.0 as well as wi-fi 802.11a/b/g/n on board in north america there are also two versions of the ipad destined for use with 4g lte networks in other parts of the world the device is compatible with 3g hspa networks just as with the last version you can buy an ipad with 16gb 32gb or 64gb of storage i tested the 64gb model with verizon lte service as i mentioned in the intro there s a new camera around back a 5 megapixel version of apple s isight or at least what it s now calling isight on the ipad the sensor utilizes backside illumination just like its iphone brethren and shares the same f/2.4 aperture the ipad s camera software is now more inline with the iphone as well up front however you re still stuck with a vga camera for facetime chats i ll get to more specific camera performance later in the review display display by now you ve probably heard all the hype about the screen on the new ipad if you haven t it s time to climb out from under that rock first things first the ipad s retina display measure 9.7 inches diagonal and has a resolution of 2048 x 1536 making it the highest resolution mobile device currently on the market the pixel density of that display is 264 ppi compared to 326 ppi on the iphone 4 / 4s and 316 ppi on something like the galaxy nexus the ipad s display however makes all other device displays look pedestrian by comparison and if you re an original ipad or ipad 2 owner.. unless you want to upgrade just avoid looking at this screen yes this display is outrageous it s stunning it s incredible i m not being hyperbolic or exaggerative when i say it is easily the most beautiful computer display i have ever looked at perhaps it has something to do with the fact that you hold this in your hands or maybe it s the technology that apple is utilizing or maybe it s the responsiveness of ios but there s something almost bizarre about how good this screen is after the launch event i described the screen as surreal and i still think that s a pretty good fit you literally can t see pixels on the ipad s display when you hold it at a regular distance and even up close you have to really inspect the thing to see dots for rendered text or high resolution images it just looks otherworldly like a glowing piece of paper there were moments when i was testing the device when i would just marvel at a single paragraph of text or i kept zooming in and out on a particular headline to see how cleanly fonts are rendered on this screen the display is so high resolution that it can actually be distracting in some ways i began to notice just how low in quality and resolution graphics can look in certain apps and web pages i even started making a list of graphic elements we need to update on the verge as with any kind of screen technology it really is the kind of thing you have to see in person when you compare the old ipad to the new one or to any other tablet for that matter you ll start to wonder how you were ever able to look at anything else i m not saying that the screen alone is reason enough to buy this product especially if you ve got a tablet you re happy with right now but i do think the quality of this display could make you a sudden convert it s just really really good yes this display is outrageous it s stunning it s incredible performance performance data battery life there s a certain kind of confidence with which it executes tasks apple has a long history of making decisions in its hardware which can sometimes compromise performance the original macbook air comes to mind for instance a groundbreaking design with relatively poor computing power the original iphone was a 2g-only device ostensibly to conserve battery life and clearly the antenna on the original iphone 4 had form-over-function syndrome at least for some users the fact that the new ipad touts an a5x soc versus a completely new generation of chip may give some buyers pause but in my testing i see no evidence that the processor in the ipad isn t every bit as powerful as it should be while there s not some obvious speed boost in comparison to the previous generation ipad there s certainly no stutter stagger or delay when using the tablet apps opened and closed quickly and without issue app switching was efficient and graphically-intensive games played smoothly on the device i saw no outstanding performance issues at all in fact whether it s a further optimization of ios the new soc or a combination of the two most likely there s little to complain about in regards to overall speed and performance what i can say most clearly about the ipad and frankly the version before this is that there s a certain kind of confidence of fearlessness with which it executes tasks with many modern mobile devices there s this constant nagging sensation that it s going to jam up freeze or otherwise not respond to your commands that sensation is nowhere to be found on the new ipad and it s a relief on the data side of things at least on verizon s lte network this thing unsurprisingly screams if you own a verizon 4g phone or know what they re capable of then you ll get the gist of what the new ipad can do actually the ipad seemed faster to me than many phones i ve tested another nice perk is that if you buy into the verizon version not only do you get your lte service on the ipad but you also can use the device as a wireless hotspot at no extra charge at amp t says they re working on it but they don t offer the same luxury in terms of raw speeds i saw downloads hit more than 22mbps while upstream data topped out around an outrageous 21mbps and that was in mid-town manhattan of course a lot of this depends on your coverage and how many people around you are on the network one other small thing i did notice the device getting a bit warm when i was using lte for extended periods of time but that s pretty common for most 4g products i ve tested as far as the battery life of the new ipad is concerned i can say that the device pretty much lives up to apple s ambitious claims i ran our battery test on the device using both wi-fi and solely on verizon s lte network and in both tests the rundown ended almost but not exactly where apple says it should the company claims you should get 10 hours of web browsing on wi-fi and 9 on lte on wi-fi i nabbed almost exactly 9 hours of constant browsing and on lte my number was closer to 8 hours and 15 minutes that s not exactly where apple pegs it but that s because our testing methods are slightly different apple sets their displays to 50 percent brightness we use 65 percent it shouldn t come as a surprise that apple is able to achieve this kind of performance the new ipad has nearly double the battery capacity of the previous version in nearly the same amount of space the ipad 2 has a 25wh battery pack while the new ipad crams in a 42.5wh slab i assume that s what accounts for most of the weight gain on this device with battery life like this i ll take the slight extra baggage and i d argue most users would prefer their devices are less lean but have longer battery life in all the new ipad lived up to my expectations on the performance and battery fronts and i m not sure how it might have surpassed them it s everything the previous generation was and then some stable reliable speedy and long-lived what more can you ask for cameras cameras apple ipad camera sample pictures previous next view full gallery previous next jdocument.readyfunction j gallery2635589 .gallery i m going to start this section by just stating once again that i believe 10-inch tablets with rear cameras are a ridiculous idea an idea perhaps best reserved for moments of desperation or raw circumstance like it s the only camera you have around when your cat begins doing something hilarious but the idea of taking this device out into the real world and attempting to snap photos with it is utterly laughable something i discovered when i took the new ipad out into the world to snap photos with it i don t care who you are what you do for a living or where you come from it s impossible not to look like a total nerd when you re in public snapping pictures with something that is literally the surface size of four point and shoot cameras that said if you absolutely must use the camera on the back of the new ipad it will actually produce pretty favorable results the auto-focus and face detection work excellently here though tapping to focus is sometimes impossible due to the size of the thing thanks to that improved sensor pictures you take on the ipad now look relatively respectable with a depth of field shallow enough to pull off rather artistic looking images colors looked good to my eyes if a little washed out and shadows and highlights both popped appropriately there s no flash present here so don t expect explosive results in low light though that larger aperture definitely allows better photos in darker places and i saw relatively good results in my testing on the video front the image stabilization is definitely needed and clearly in play when you re bouncing around and the hd content the new ipad captured looked crisp and stutter-free again i can t see a situation where you re really going to be shooting any kind of long-form video with this device but if you absolutely must it does a surprisingly respectable job around front you can expect the same basic quality of the last generation ipad which means it s nothing to write home about it would have been nice to see at least a 720p shooter on the flip side of the tablet considering how hard apple s been trying to push facetime but you re stuck with vga here 10-inch tablets with rear cameras are a ridiculous idea software software meet the new boss same as the old boss ipad review software screenshots previous next view full gallery previous next jdocument.readyfunction j gallery2636210 .gallery it should come as no surprise that the software on the new ipad is basically the same as the software on the last ipad that is it s ios 5.1 which is now available for pretty much all of apple s mobile devices the ipad 2 and new ipad are functionally the same and can both run the same software including apple s new iphoto for ipad and the updated garageband overall there are some very minor tweaks to the way the os operates for instance on the lock screen you now have to swipe to bring up the camera but overall it s exactly like the version of ios you ve been looking at since ios 5 was launched alongside the iphone 4s there are some minor but welcome changes though like the fact that you can now download multiple apps from the app store without being kicked back to the homescreen every time you select something apple has also added its voice dictation seen first in the iphone 4s which is surprisingly fast and accurate for users who can t adjust to the virtual keyboard this may be a happy middle-ground the overall performance of the software is very very good in fact in terms of fluidity stability touch response and general cohesion there s no other tablet os that comes close android 4.0 is getting there though i have yet to use a stock version of that os for an android tablet and the tablet i ve used most the asus transformer prime has had some issues certainly when it comes to completeness third-party app selection and overall ease-of-use there is no comparison while much of ios for a tablet is wonderful i do have some gripes for some reason apple removed the calculator stock and weather apps when it introduced the ipad and it has yet to replace them this is especially egregious given the fact that the ipad now shares ios 5 s notification center which would be a perfect place for a persistent weather report or stock update the lack of those features actually shines a light on one of the biggest missed opportunities on the ipad since day one widgets i ve been complaining about the lack of quickly accessible glanceable information on this platform since launch day and my feelings haven t changed one bit the fact that apple continues to ignore the issue and actually made the experience worse on the ipad seems just plain bizarre to me how many years will this weather icon simply read 73 degrees and sunny apps new and updated apps the biggest piece of the new ipad puzzle is one of the apps introduced alongside the tablet apple is now offering iphoto for the ipad and iphones and ipod touches too and like pages keynote and numbers it s approaching real-world productivity the basic concept of iphoto is that it takes much of the editing features added into the photo app on ios devices and just explodes them this is a much more full-featured application which allows you to do all sorts of very specific editing of photos including adjusting exposure coloring retouching using multitouch gestures cropping rotating repairing and more the app also gives you a handful of instagram-style retro filters as well as a way to add a vignette to your images to give them that burnt-in old school feel apple seems interested in selling its products as content creation devicesyou re also able to collect your images together along with dates maps and weather er.. widgets into virtual scrapbooks which apple calls journals those journals can then be uploaded to icloud and shared via a specific url sent to itunes or beamed to an apple tv that s pretty significant since apple canned the ability to share photos on the web when it introduced icloud iphoto and garageband are powerful tools in all it s an excellent example of the depth and breadth possible in ios apps and though it certainly won t stand in as a replacement for photoshop it s capable of handling most of the needs of an average and even above average user even relatively pro shooters may find some utility here as you re able to import edit and export raw files in addition to the standard crop of jpeg or png formats apple has also updated garageband like iphoto not a stock part of the os to include some interesting new features most notably the ability to jam with up to four other garageband users on the same network it s actually a pretty amazing trick one of the players leads the group controls playback tempo and recording while everyone is free to riff on their own part if recording each instrument is tracked on the band leader s device and also duplicated on the player s machine it s a fascinating way to play music in a group or even solo with two devices and shows that apple is legitimately interested in continuing to sell its products as content creation devices not just toys for passive lean-back experiences live

year s ipad 2 its internal components and wireless capabilities have only received a predictable bump you d think apple fell asleep at the wheel with this one--until that moment when you turn on the screen when i tell you that apple has doubled the ipad s screen resolution to an unprecedented 2 048x1 536 pixels your eyes should water a little no other screen in your home can compete with this resolution--not your laptop not your desktop computer not even your 1080p tv for a device that fits in your lap and costs as little as 499 a screen like this is an impressive feat photo gallery apple ipad speaking of pricing the going rate for an ipad hasn t changed since the tablet s introduction in 2010 the 499 entry-level price buys you 16gb of built-in storage spending 599 buys you twice the room 32gb and 699 will bring you up to 64gb all three models can access the internet over wi-fi and are available in either black or white if you want the added ability to access the internet over a 4g or 3g cellular network verizon or at amp t tack on an extra 130 for the ipad uninitiated looking to save a little money apple is keeping around the 2011 ipad 2 16gb priced at 399 or 529 for a model with 3g at amp t or verizon it s a good price especially considering that the ipad 2 is still leagues better than many of the tablets we ve seen this year but if you want the bragging rights and a renewed lease on the cutting edge of tablet technology the new ipad is the way to go design looking at the new ipad you d think someone was playing a trick on you it looks almost exactly like last year s model the tablet s glass and aluminum construction is still 9.5 inches tall and 7.31 inches wide thickness is now up slightly at 0.37 inch weighing in at a beefier 1.44 pounds you get the same home button on the bottom of the screen and a volume rocker on the right side along with the mute switch/rotation lock up top you have the sleep/wake button and headphone output and the bottom edge

being one of the thinnest lightest tablets on the market may leave some room for competitors already we re seeing tablets like the toshiba excite x10 le which are thinner than the ipad 2 and just as light apple is betting that a best-in-class screen will trump any concerns over the slight uptick in weight and thickness and if they re wrong well the ipad 2 is still around for those who can t bear the extra 51 grams but the surefire way to tell a new ipad apart from an ipad 2 aside from counting pixels or breaking out the scale is to flip them over no this isn t a tablet gender test what you re looking for here is the rear camera in the top-left corner on the new model the camera is slightly larger accounting for the improved optics and camera sensor similar to what s used in the iphone 4s though not identical new features beyond the vastly improved screen there are a number of other upgrades worth mentioning the ipad s processor has been upgraded to what apple is calling an a5x like the a5 processor used in the ipad 2 this cpu remains dual-core the x is there to signify that the graphics processor has been beefed up to quad-core this seems to be a necessary measure for juggling four times the pixels of the previous model but regardless games and graphics perform fluidly against everyone s expectations apple did not include its siri digital assistant on the new ipad--at least not entirely siri s voice-to-text dictation capability has migrated to the ipad but that s it if you want to find nearby sushi restaurants you re going to have to search for the answer online like a neanderthal still the addition of voice dictation is a welcome feature and it can be handy for composing quick e-mails and bypassing the touch-screen keyboard when searching for information online its accuracy leaves a little to be desired though just like autocorrected typing the ipad s dictation isn t infallible photo gallery new ipad vs iphone 4s camera test last but not least there s the ipad s updated rear camera which the company calls its isight camera it is a huge improvement over the ipad 2 s 0.7-megapixel shooter this updated shooter is now 5 megapixels if you ve spent any time over on apple s ipad page you ve probably seen the exploded view of apple s five-element lens system which was adopted from the iphone however you want to explain it the photo quality is exceptional for a tablet and we have the photos to prove it i still contend that it s a bit silly waving a tablet around to capture photos and video but i understand the counterpoint and i ll admit that the ipad s screen makes a better display than any camera smartphone or photo frame features we take for granted let s not forget all the features that made the first two ipads unbeatable if you ve ever used an iphone or ipod touch the new ipad will feel immediately familiar out of the box you get many of the iphone s capabilities including apple-designed apps for web browsing e-mail maps photos music video and youtube more apps can be installed using the built-in app store software or by connecting the ipad to itunes via your computer using the included cable if you already own apps purchased for an iphone or ipod touch you can transfer these apps to the ipad as well the original ipad made its debut with ios 3.2 that os limitations seem prehistoric today you couldn t bounce between applications with multitasking you couldn t organize applications into folders and support for document printing and airplay streaming of music videos and photos didn t arrive until november 2010 at launch the new ipad comes with ios 5.1 see our full rundown recently added features such as imessage newsstand notifications and twitter integration are all included along with support for apple s free icloud online backup service one sticking point in the original ipad that apple hasn t addressed in the new ipad is adobe flash support for apple s safari web browser apple seems dead set against supporting adobe s popular tool for presenting video and graphics on the web and without it some corners of the web are still inaccessible on the ipad to apple s credit even the maker of flash adobe has conceded that html5 is a better solution for presenting content on mobile devices going forward as such the web is steadily bending toward greater compatibility with the ipad and the issue of flash compatibility seems less contentious than it once was in terms of browser features the ipad s safari browser matches what you ll find from the best competing tablets with google s recent improvements to android s chrome web browser in android 4.0 apple now has some tough competition but in terms of the subjective web-browsing experience apple s retina display gives the new ipad a decisive victory because text is rendered with such razor-sharp clarity everything from facebook to the new york times take on a printlike quality that is easier on the eyes than what any laptop or tablet offers to 4g or not to 4g for those who just get a little itchy at the idea of not being connected to the internet apple offers a version of the ipad with an integrated 4g cellular data connection priced at a 130 premium over models that only offer wi-fi the jury seems split on whether the added cost of a cellular data capability is money well spent or an unnecessary expense ultimately if you can afford it do it aside from the 10 grams it adds to the ipad s overall weight there are no drawbacks to owning an ipad 4g model other than the data plan it requires yet unlike so many 4g tablets on the market apple s requires no contracts the data plans you purchase month to month can be ratcheted up and down as you please another advantage of ipad with 4g is the added capability of assisted gps a-gps allowing users to accurately pinpoint their locations on a map and take advantage of navigation and location-aware apps the wi-fi-only models of the ipad can use rudimentary wi-fi hot-spot triangulation techniques to guess locations but are much less accurate and consistent ipad global speed test the 4g version of the ipad also includes a 4g hot-spot capability allowing other wi-fi devices laptops tablets portable media players to take advantage of the cellular data at launch only verizon s ipad 4g supported this hot-spot feature but at amp t may eventually offer the service as well our tested download and upload speeds using the ipad as a 4g hot spot found a slight but negligible drop in data performance if you have no plans to regularly use the ipad outside of your home you d do just as well to save some money and stick with a wi-fi model but if you do take the plunge the 4g download performance on either network should knock your socks off provided that you live in an area that supports it for more see our separate cnet how to on choosing the right carrier for the ipad as well as a side-by-side comparison of each carrier s 4g lte service ipad as e-reader as far as e-book content goes the ipad has you covered every major e-book retailer and quite a few specialized stores offer an ipad app including barnes amp noble amazon kobo google books stanza and apple s own ibooks mainstream magazines including the new yorker wired and vanity fair all have ipad-specific editions even specialty publications such as comic books test prep and sheet music have found their way onto the ipad but when you compare the experience of reading on the ipad with its paper-based ancestor or dedicated e-ink readers the ipad still falls short it s beefy at 1.44 pounds a kindle touch weighs under half a pound and in spite of the retina display s exquisitely rendered text glare is still an issue--especially outdoors also a product like the nook simple touch promises up to two months of reading without a recharge whereas the ipad will only get you 10 hours in spite of all these criticisms the ipad has already proven itself a success as an e-reader there are certainly cheaper options out

'),(380,'2012-03-19 00:00:00',9.0,73,' the new ipad s screen must be seen to be believed photo ariel zambelich/wired an apple ipad has never looked so awful no i m not referring to the new ipad the one with the ballyhooed retina display i m referring to last year s ipad 2 whose screen now looks grainy and pixelated when viewed alongside apple s latest tablet the improvement in display quality smacks you in the face as soon as you compare the two ipad models and it s an upgrade that forces a nagging question where does apple go from here the company now leads all competitors in tablet display quality hands down in fact the display in the new ipad is so beautiful so deft in rendering images video and text it s unlikely apple will update the screen in next year s ipad model the new ipad serves as a warning that apple could be running out of ways to significantly advance the tablet art form as for the new ipad s other upgrades they re iterative not revolutionary but they also handily deliver all that we expect let alone need from a state-of-the-art tablet if anything the new ipad serves as a warning that apple could be running out of ways to significantly advance the tablet art form that s a problem for a company that depends on revolutionary hardware design to move the manic masses has the ipad line reached its natural conclusion is there nothing left to improve i ll answer those questions at the end of this review but let s first study the two key features the new display and faster wireless connectivity that make the new ipad a wise upgrade over ipad 2 for some users if not also the best tablet available today retina display here we see text as rendered by the retina display our photo and likely your viewing display cannot do justice to the sharpness of the text photo ariel zambelich/wired the new ipad screen measures 9.7 diagonal inches just like the previous model but now boasts a 2048 x 1536 resolution that s good for 3.1 million pixels four times the pixels of the ipad 2 and original ipad which share the same 1024 x 768 screen but how does the new display actually look in a word spectacular when i first demoed the new ipad at apple s launch event i was dismissive of its so-called retina display because near-identical screen technology can be found in the iphone 4 and 4s i use my 4s roughly 30 to 40 times a day and i thought i had become indifferent to a retina display s charms however now that i can directly compare the screens of the ipad 2 and new ipad side by side it s clear the 9.7-inch retina display is a huge improvement individual text characters look like they re stamped directly onto the screen with the world s most exacting letter press sharp and coherent with an almost molecular level of precision text on the new ipad is vividly crisper and sharper and this is a big advantage for any tablet which unlike a smartphone must function as a platform for relatively long-form reading on the new ipad individual text characters look like they re stamped directly onto the screen with the world s most exacting letter press sharp and coherent with an almost molecular level of precision by comparison text on the ipad 2 now looks outright crude visibly pixelated even blurry in fact everything now looks sub-standard on the original ipad and ipad 2 on the older ipads the curved corners of home screen icons reveal pixels not perfectly crisp lines as on the new retina display and on apple s new screen high-resolution photos render in full glory bearing the appearance of continuous-tone photo lab prints individual pixels are imperceptible and the whole effect delivers a level of visual clarity that trumps not only other computing devices but also any book or magazine produced via traditional off-set printing apple says the new display bests its predecessor with 44 percent better color saturation and anecdotal observation backs this up colors are noticeably richer and more brilliant relative to the reproduction mustered by the ipad 2 colors also appear to render more accurately on the new display comparing control images i shot with the iphone 4s the new ipad beat the ipad 2 with a dynamic range that more closely matches the appearance of real-world objects downsides well like all ipads the new one bears a screen with a 4 3 aspect ratio apple s latest tablet supports native 1080p video but all hd video content that isn t letter-boxed will have significant black bands above and below the action which isn t the case with 16 10 aspect ratio android tablets the ipad s aspect ratio reduces the wow factor of big-budget hollywood content but if the kindle fire has taught us anything it s that most consumers find smaller video windows perfectly acceptable pages 1 2 3 4 view all

surrounded by a black or white bezel with a curved metal back and a single home button apple s magnetic smart cover which was released with the ipad 2 clips on just fine the tablet still has a sealed-in battery and no ports other than a microsim slot a standard headphone jack and an apple 30-pin dock connector if you look closely you ll notice that at 7.3 by 9.5 by 0.37 inches hwd and 23.3 ounces it s just a hair thicker and a smidge heavier than the ipad 2 but you wouldn t notice if you weren t holding both tablets at once the additional weight is because of a much larger battery although the new ipad promises the same battery life as the previous model the 4g radio and sharper screen are just much more power hungry the 2 048-by-1 536-pixel retina display is as beautiful as you ve heard and colors are more saturated than on the previous model it s still reflective which creates some problems outdoors but at 264 pixels per inch it s the sharpest tablet screen there is several times during this review i d pick up the new ipad do something and be afraid i had mistakenly picked up the ipad 2 so then i d pick up the ipad 2 look at its screen and be horrified at the

out of data but that s almost too late invest instead in sigterm s 99-cent data usage app and stick it on your first home screen it keeps constant track of how much cellular data you ve used by floating a percentage over its icon i have some more tips for conserving 4g data in a separate story processing power and battery lifethe new ipad s a5x processor a dual-core cortex-a9 running at 1ghz is the same cpu as in the previous ipad with a better gpu to handle the higher-resolution screen in tests we saw similar performance with both the geekbench processor/memory benchmark at 761 and rightware s browsermark benchmark at 102 096 falling very close to the scores for the ipad 2 according to apple the new gpu offers four times the performance of the ipad 2 which turns out to mean that it offers the same performance while pushing four times the pixels in the glbenchmark 2.1.2 egypt high test which creates a simulated 3d game scene the ipad 2 and new ipad had almost exactly the same frame rate of 28 frames per second but remember the new ipad has to work four times as hard to get there the egypt offscreen test which takes displaying actual pixels out of the equation drew 50 percent more frames on the new ipad than the ipad 2 highlighting the additional graphics power but benchmarks have never been a good measure of the ipad user experience because there s a lot of clever programming involved apple prioritizes user input which means buttons respond quickly and scrolling and zooming are always smooth that programming rather than raw cpu speed is why ipads feel faster than android tablets app developers may be pushing the limits of the a5 s power though in the retina-display-enhanced barefoot atlas and real racing 2 hd apps i saw occasional stutters when zooming or rotating complex rendered objects this didn t occur in on-board apps such as the safari web browser or the video player apple estimates the 42.5-watt-hour cell will deliver 10 hours of usage time on wi-fi and 9 hours on 4g which is very good for a large-screen tablet in our ipad battery tests i found battery life to be highly dependent on screen brightness i got only 5 hours 33 minutes of video

the pricing for the wi-fi 3g models is 629 for 16gb 729 for 32gb and 829 for 64gb in the u.s the 3g version is available on both at amp t and verizon wireless at amp t s monthly plans are as follows 14.99 per month for 250mb with a 14.99 overage fee for every 250mb above the limit or 25 per month for 2gb with 10 overage for every 1gb on verizon monthly plans cost 20 for 1gb of data 35 for 3gb 50 for 5gb and 80 for 10gb with a 20 overage fee for the 20/month plan and 10 overage fee for the others for both at amp t and verizon ipad service is a month-to-month proposition so you aren t tethered to a long-term contract with either carrier that said once you buy a verizon ipad 2 it s locked to verizon so you can t opt for at amp t service or vice versa view all 14 photos in gallery designmeasuring 9.50 by 7.31 by 0.34 inches hwd the weight of the ipad 2 varies slightly with each model the heaviest model by a hair is the at amp t wi-fi 3g ipad at 1.35 pounds the verizon version which we tested weighs 1.34 pounds and the wi-fi only model is 1.33 pounds the original ipad measured 9.56 by 7.47 by 0.5 inches and weighed 1.5 pounds so the tablet has slimmed down some but your hands are not going to notice much difference in weight after holding either device for more than ten minutes the real physical change is in the contour the ipad 2 has rounded narrow edges whereas the original tablet was a bit boxier with wider side panels sign up for the pc magazine digital edition for ipad the 9.7-inch led-backlit multitouch-enabled display remains unchanged from the first ipad in terms of size and 1 024-by-768 resolution the front panel is still covered by glass but now the screen is framed in either glossy black or glossy white the back panel is brushed aluminum on both the black and white models and prominently features the apple logo right in the middle as for controls and hardware the front panel houses the new-to-this-model front-facing vga-quality camera lens and the old familiar apple home button which sits as usual below the screen the left-hand panel has nothing the eye can see but houses magnets below the surface for the smart cover accessory more on that later a new switch for locking the screen s orientation or muting the audio you assign the function in the settings menu is situated above the volume controls on the right panel the 30-pin connector for docking and syncing along with the integrated speaker which is the same two-channel-but-no-stereo-separation speaker you ll find on the original ipad are on the bottom of the tablet s back panel at the top the sleep/wake button sits alongside the cellular antenna which is hidden by a black plastic strip the microphone and 3.5mm headphone jack the back-left corner also houses the new rear-facing camera lens which captures 720p30 video and 0.7-megaxpixel yikes stills included with the ipad 2 a standard-issue apple white sync cable and a charger and that s pretty much it you still won t find earbuds in the box which despite how awful apple earbuds sound should be included with a 500 device with a headphone jack processor amp gutsinternally the new 1-ghz dual-core a5 processor only the second chip apple has deigned to name and show off however vaguely to the public is a custom-designed high-performance low-power system-on-a-chip to quote the company directly steve jobs claims it is up to nine times faster than the a4 chip for graphics processing we know very little about the a5 beyond these stats thus far but it is a noticeable improvement over the a4 s already strong graphics processing for example the real-time effects it s able to render to live images in photo booth are quite impressive for both their speed and grace you almost never see the ipad stutter or slow down during a game or video although it did crash a couple of times with one particular app more on that in a bit additionally the ipad 2 has three sensors one of them a new three-axis gyroscope this adds a new dimension to how you can play games and use apps not only does the gyro sense when you switch between vertical and horizontal viewing but the ipad knows when you re holding it above your head below you or spinning around in a chair and certain apps and games like jenga take advantage of this the 3g radio for the ipad delivers solid speed that s in line with other verizon 3g devices to no one s surprise our speed tests varied significantly depending on our locations in manhattan and brooklyn the combined results yielded averages of 0.72 mbps up and 1.35 mbps down over 3g over wi-fi we got 14.1 mbps down and 0.61 mbps up very similar numbers to the motorola xoom the ipad 2 can connect to 802.11b/g/n wireless networks and integrates bluetooth 2.1 edr you can easily connect a wireless keyboard to the ipad but wireless mice aren t supported this was also the case with the original ipad the motorola xoom is currently 3g as well but motorola and verizon promise free

for the wi-fi version 529 for the at amp t 3g or verizon 3g version the competition must really hate apple the apple ipad wasn t just a successful tablet computer in 2010--it was the tablet computer in one fell swoop apple created the new tablet market and sold tens of millions of ipads in spite of a global economic downturn and considerable skepticism the same only better with the ipad s second go-around apple sticks to its successful formula the ipad 2 is thinner faster and includes two cameras but otherwise the ipad stays the same size price capacity and features all carry over oh except for color apple now offers both white and black versions of the ipad 2 in every price and configuration the base model starts at 499 giving you 16gb of storage and a wi-fi connection to the internet if you want more storage for all your applications photos music and videos you can jump up to the 32gb 599 or 64gb 699 models the freedom to surf the web over a 3g cellular connection costs an extra 130 for any of the three models mentioned above plus monthly carrier fees unlike with the original ipad you now have a choice of two carriers verizon or at amp t choose carefully though since the verizon version of the ipad can t be made to work on at amp t and vice versa the hardware the ipad 2 is thin--so thin in fact that it feels like a different device measuring just 0.34 of an inch it s thinner than the iphone 4 and a third thinner than the original ipad despite the thinner design its construction quality is no less rugged than the original s the back of the ipad is still made from a durable single slab of aluminum machined to fit the ipad s internal components like a glove the face of the ipad is covered in the same scratch-resistant glass with a home button at the bottom of the screen and a new front-facing camera at the top otherwise the ipad 2 sticks to familiar ipad routines the sleep/wake buttons and headphone jack are in the same place as on the original up top as are the volume rocker and mute/rotation lock switch on the right edge on the bottom you ll find the ipad s universal dock connection and the internal speaker the speaker s perforated grille now wraps around the back giving it more surface area and noticeably better sound quality the height and width may look similar but in terms of thickness the ipad has done some dieting shrinking from 13.4mm thick on the original model to 8.8mm thick for the ipad 2 it s thinner even than the iphone 4 for the ipad 2 apple has avoided compatibility shenanigans with the exception of any original ipad cases the device works with first-gen accessories docks adapters speakers video cables chargers though first-gen docks don t fit like a glove an updated standard dock for the ipad 2 is available for keyboard support apple now recommends its bluetooth wireless keyboard the ipad 2 accessory that s really getting all the attention is apple s new smart cover an answer to all the bulky overdone rubber third-party cases made for the first ipad apple s unique hinged cover comes in two materials--leather 59 and polyurethane 39--and multiple colors it attaches magnetically to the left or right edge of the ipad 2 using two aluminum hinges embedded with impressively strong rare-earth magnets magnets within the cover are used to detect when the cover is open or shut allowing the ipad 2 to automatically wake or sleep it works but you also have the option in settings to bypass the automatic wake feature and use the button manually apple ipad 2 and smart cover photos 1-2 of 17 scroll left scroll right as accessories go the smart cover is nifty--not so much for the protection it offers but for the convenient stand it provides when rolled up if on the other hand you are seriously concerned about protecting your investment keeping the ipad 2 in a traditional wraparound case is still the best way to go features new stuff the ipad 2 isn t a radical departure from the original but it does have a few new tricks up its sleeve the banner feature for the ipad 2 is the addition of two cameras both able to record video or snap photos the camera on the back is located in the upper-right corner where it isn t likely to be covered by your hand in portrait orientation at least it looks just like the chrome-ringed lens on the iphone 4 and is similarly blessed with 720p video capture there s no camera flash however and the camera sensor is a far cry from the one used in the iphone 4 just like the fourth-generation ipod touch the ipad 2 takes photos that are essentially video stills a gallery of photos taken with the ipad 2 can be seen here the ipad 2 boasts two cameras the original ipad doesn t even have one the rear-facing camera pictured here supports 720p video capture even if apple had gone the route of using a carl zeiss lens and a 10-megapixel sensor the ipad 2 just isn t a replacement for a camera or smartphone having tested the camera quality of tablets over the past year we can t stress enough how silly you feel shooting videos or photos with a tablet in public it s like taking a picture with a cutting board your grandfather s camera was less conspicuous you get looks and they re not the envious kind the ipad s rear-facing camera won t replace your point-and-shoot but the image quality isn t bad really the cameras are there as a way to support apple s facetime video chat app which is now available for mac iphone ipod touch and ipad 2 if you ve been waiting for the jetsons video phone facetime on the ipad gets you pretty close unlike smaller devices the ipad s 9.7-inch screen can present faces at life-size we ve seen this before with desktop- and laptop-based video calling but it can be uncanny to actually hold an image of someone s life-size face in your hands facetime still remains a wi-fi-only feature however so in-car ipad video calls are an elusive capability probably to humanity s advantage other ipad 2 apps designed by apple include garageband and imovie which must be purchased separately for 4.99 each the ipad is the last of apple s ios devices to be blessed with imovie and the camera required for it but is the first to receive garageband we have separate write-ups of garageband for ipad and imovie for ipad available for more depth under the hood the ipad 2 has plenty to brag about the new spec uses a dual-core a5 processor that promises to be twice as fast with nine times the graphics performance if gaming graphic quality is an important consideration for you you can jump ahead to the performance section of this review apple ipad 2 photos 1-2 of 12 scroll left scroll right another feature sure to burn the competition is full hdmi av output compatibility using a 39 dock cable the ipad can now mirror its output to a tv over a standard hdmi connection the supported resolution goes up to 1080p though video playback and most apps never break out of 720p unlike previous video-out solutions for the ipad this cable no longer limits users to simply video playback or presentations everything you see on the screen is mirrored on your tv including video photos games and the home screen competitors such as rim s blackberry playbook and the motorola xoom have been waving hdmi compatibility as a key advantage over the ipad now they have one fewer bragging point the ipad 2 also adds the same three-axis gyroscope sensor shared by the iphone 4 and ipod touch giving the device a more detailed sense of its orientation in space similar to the feeling of holding a nintendo wii remote the gyro s appeal is mostly for gaming allowing for more precise motion control and realistic navigation within virtual environments in a first-person shooter game like n.o.v.a for instance you can tilt the ipad 2 s screen up down left or right to explore the game s surroundings just like a window into the game s universe features oldies but goodies cameras and gyros are nice but let s not forget all the features that made the original ipad unbeatable if you ve ever used an iphone or ipod touch the ipad 2 will feel immediately familiar out of the box you get many of the iphone s capabilities including apple-designed apps for web browsing e-mail maps photos music video and youtube more apps can be installed using the built-in app store software or by connecting the ipad to itunes via your computer using the included cable if you already own apps purchased for an iphone or ipod touch you can transfer these apps to the ipad as well the original ipad made its debut with ios 3.2 that os limitations seem prehistoric today you couldn t bounce between applications with multitasking you couldn t organize applications into folders and support for document printing and airplay streaming of music videos and photos didn t arrive until november 2010 at launch the ipad 2 comes with ios 4.3 bringing a host of important new features and improvements there are new apps for photo booth a dedicated portrait-taking app and facetime video chat the safari web browser gets a speed boost under the hood for improved javascript rendering the app now includes a home sharing option for streaming media over your home network from local computers and for those of you who want flexible control over the function of the switch above the ipad s volume buttons ios 4.3 hands over the reins and allows you to designate it as either a rotation lock or a mute for system alert sounds such as incoming facetime calls one sticking point in the original ipad that apple hasn t addressed in the ipad 2 is adobe flash support for apple s safari web browser apple seems dead set against supporting adobe s popular tool for presenting video and graphics on the web and without it many corners of the web are inaccessible on the ipad or present a swiss cheese of broken content for the most part though the ipad s web-browsing experience is the best you ll find on a tablet navigation is responsive zooming in and out of text is fluid and managing multiple open pages is a cinch the ipad s device features such as bluetooth 2.1 a2dp edr wi-fi 802.11 n 3g and 10 hours of battery life are all here and in many cases are still the bar by which other tablets are judged wi-fi versus 3g for road warriors or those who just get a little itchy at the idea of not being connected to the internet apple offers a version of the ipad with an integrated 3g cellular data connection aside from a negligible added heft of 0.1 pound and the fact that buyers are paying an extra 130 for the 3g capability compared with wi-fi-only models there s no downside to owning a 3g-compatible model unlike the data plans for most smartphones the ipad doesn t come with any long-term contractual obligations if you don t end up using the ipad s 3g capability you can cancel the data plan at any time if you decide to go with the 3g option for the ipad 2 you have your choice of two carriers at amp t or verizon data plans and fees differ between the two carriers and are always subject to change and the 3g cellular technology under the hood differs as well the at amp t ipad model uses a gsm modem and a micro-sim card slot allowing you to easily swap in compatible micro-sim cards from foreign carriers when overseas verizon s ipad uses a cdma 3g modem and lacks the sim-swapping feature of at amp t s gsm modem making it a poor choice for international jet-setters as far as data plans go at amp t offers two options 15 a month for 250mb of data or 25 a month for 2gb each option can be prepaid for a month and

'),(386,'2011-03-14 00:00:00',9.0,74,' everybody wishes the ipad 2 had a higher-resolution display like the iphone 4 but apple didn t even have to go there yet all apple did was put the ipad on a treadmill the tablet shed some weight and gained some speed to become the ipad 2 and it s incredible what a difference that makes it feels like a brand-new product most important of all is the ipad 2 s thinness the ipad 2 is 0.34 inches thick about 33 percent thinner than its predecessor now reaching your fingers across the screen to swipe and tap is far easier than it was on the chunkier ipad 1 people who enjoy reading will love the thinner body cradling an ipad 2 in your hands for an hour doesn t feel that cumbersome you ll also be surprised how often you ll be using the tablet with one hand even though it s only a few ounces lighter than the older ipad 1.3 pounds versus 1.5 pounds the changes to the tablet s weight and ergonomics feel substantial the ipad 2 is only slightly thicker than a pencil imagine how significant thinness and weight are for people who are considering tablets for use in a professional field that requires a lot of moving around such as doctors who could use the ipad to replace a stack of x-rays architects relying on an ipad as an interactive display for blueprints or students using the ipad as an all-in-one textbook note-taker and daily planner the thinner and lighter a tablet gets the more useful it becomes for various types of customers as a standalone device the ipad 2 s soft keys still aren t ideal for typing compared to a physical keyboard however this problem seems to be eroding over time as the skinnier profile already makes it easier to hold the device with one hand while pecking away on keys with the other also apple s smart cover protective accessory sold separately for 40 to 70 is a cover that folds to create an angle to prop up the device so you can type on it more comfortably the built-in magnets which cling to the side of the ipad are very cool and make the cover extremely easy to take off or put on personally i prefer using most gadgets bareback but the smart cover is the only cover i d consider keeping with the ipad 2 since it s so easy to take off the other most important change is speed apple claims the new a5 processor in the ipad 2 offers double the performance of the original ipad indeed apps and websites load more quickly and 3-d games look more detailed the entire ios experience is just buttery smooth runmobilecompatibilityscript myexperience826030081001 anid brightcove.createexperiences web performance has largely improved thanks to ios 4.3 the latest software update shipping with the ipad 2 which includes an improved javascript-rendering engine for safari the ipad 2 took 2 180 milliseconds to complete a sunspider benchmark test whereas the ipad 1 took 3 353 milliseconds running the earlier ios 4.2 the ipad 1 took over 8 100 milliseconds to complete the same test that means javascript-heavy websites such as gmail should run significantly faster surprisingly despite the major speed boost the ipad 2 retains a 10-hour battery life the same as the slower first-gen ipad pages

target customer and a few pesky omissions are overshadowed by the excellent overall experience you get with apple s ipad and it sets the bar high for competing products in this nascent internet tablet category by tim gideon after it was announced back in january the unfortunately named apple ipad 699 direct 64gb wi-fi seemed like it could be the company s first major clunker in a long time an expensive niche product that would inhabit a nebulous region between laptops and smartphones but wouldn t quite eliminate the need for either one aside from apple enthusiasts many of us wondered who would drop hundreds of dollars for this not-quite-computer but having used the ipad for some time i can tell you that the device just makes sense when you combine basic-but-essential work tools with iwork an improved browser e-mail ipod and photo applications a well-executed e-book platform with ibooks and throw in thousands of downloadable apps and games and package it all in a gorgeous slim slate with a beautiful 9.7-inch touch screen you have yourself a winner is the ipad cheap no is it flawless not at all omissions including support for multitasking a built-in camera for video chats and flash support in safari leave room for improvement but otherwise the apple ipad is a very convincing debut and it will undoubtedly be a driving force in shaping the emerging tablet landscape

you ll need to pay at amp t for 3g coverage the device is locked to at amp t s network so you can t use another mobile carrier you can opt to pay for coverage on a continual monthly basis 14.99 per month for 250mb or 29.99 a month for unlimited data there s no commitment or contract to sign so you can switch your 3g service on and off whenever you like and with no service your 3g ipad will still be able to connect to the web via wi-fi in the u.s you can purchase at amp t s 3g service right on your ipad 3g the ipad measures 9.56 by 7.47 by 0.50 inches hwd and looks a lot like a giant ipod touch 299 32gb except for its brushed aluminum back the ipod touch has a shiny metallic back from all the hype you might expect it to be featherweight and if you re tucking it into a bag it s a lot lighter to tote than a laptop but at 1.5 pounds the ipad feels a little heavy when you hold it up with a single hand for long periods the 9.7-inch led-backlit ips touch-screen display which features 1024-by-768-pixel resolution is framed by a 1-inch black border if you re holding the ipad vertically below the display you ll find apple s familiar home button which when pressed whisks you back to the ipad s main screen along the top panel there s a headphone jack a microphone and an on/off button the left panel is clean while the right panel houses the volume rocker and the screen-rotation lock which is a hold button for the accelerometer so that sudden moves don t unintentionally shift the ipad s screen orientation the built-in speaker and proprietary 30-pin connector live on the bottom panel it s also worth noting that the hole that appears below the surface above the display is an ambient light sensor the fact that you won t find a single port usb or otherwise tells you that this product is not meant to be a full-fledged computer or the substitute for one apple expects you to use e-mail and syncing to shuttle files and documents between the ipad and your computer i can understand the decision not to include usb ports the ipad is basically a big ipod touch with added capabilities and decking it out with a bunch of ports opens a can of worms the ipad isn t intended to deal with still this is bound to be a deal breaker for plenty of potential buyers included in the box a 30-pin to usb cable to sync and charge your ipad with your computer a 10w usb power adapter and minimal documentation you don t get apple s signature white earbuds and there s no screen-cleaning cloth and trust me after 30 minutes of your fingers all over the glossy screen you ll need to wipe it down despite the oleophobic fingerprint-resistant coating what s under the ipad s hood the ipad runs iphone os 3.2 and is currently the only device that runs this version of the operating system basically it s an ipad-optimized version of the current iphone os tweaked for the ipad s larger screen and new apps so just like an iphone the ipad lacks the ability to run multiple tasks at one time the mysterious in-house-designed 1ghz a4 chip gets little official comment from apple other than being described as fast and power efficient the a4 s main application processor is thought to be of a similar architecture to the cortex-a8 processor used in the iphone 3gs 199 16gb palm pre 299.99 and motorola droid 199.99 just faster the htc hd2 199.99 and lg expo 199.99 smartphones also use 1-ghz cortex-a8-class processors as does the lenovo skylight u1 tablet the ipad s graphics capabilities come from a powervr sgx gpu similar to the one found in the iphone 3gs and ipod touch if the ipad is using the same powervr sgx 535 as in the 3gs it can render about 28 million polygons/second which is more powerful than the qualcomm snapdragon found in devices like the htc hd2 but is well behind the muscle of samsung s latest handheld graphics hardware since apple hasn t released the exact model of the ipad s powervr sgx it may be of a newer vintage than the 535 the screen does seem to respond almost instantly so whatever it is that powers the a4 chip it s rumored to be designed by former amd and ati chip design veterans offers an impeccable touch-screen experience the power efficiency of the chip translates to a battery life that apple rates at up to ten hours with wi-fi switched on our own rundown test of the rechargeable lithium-polymer battery netted a respectably close battery

results from cnet labs photo gallery apple ipad the apple ipad is an unprecedented device it doesn t shoot rainbows or make puppies but this roughly 8x10-inch tablet computer melds your laptop smartphone gaming console and ipod into a single affordable unfortunately named thing of course we come to you with a standard list of complaints the absence of an integrated video camera puts the kibosh on any hope of using the ipad for video chats and without flash video support many web pages look like swiss cheese but the biggest problem with the device is coming up with bullet-proof reasons to buy one because the ipad is an entirely new class of device you ll probably need to lie to yourself a little to justify the purchase but at this point any cnet readers worth their salt have mastered the art of making excuses to buy new gadgets for the uninitiated apple has posted a cheat sheet of demo videos that provide a smorgasbord of reasonable answers to the question why do i need an ipad to hear apple tell it the ipad is a web browser for your living room an e-book reader for the den a movie player for the kids a photo album a jukebox a gamer s best friend a word processor an e-mail machine and a youtube junkie s dream come true no excuse good enough for you wait a few minutes and a developer will inevitably make an app for it whatever you need to tell yourself to buy an ipad we can safely say the device is a worthwhile addition to any wired home we don t give much weight to the pundits who say that the ipad is the future of the personal computer but we think it s the most entertaining gadget we ll see all year what is it exactly if you re coming to this review already versed on the nitty gritty of what the ipad is and its roots in the iphone and ipod touch feel free to skip ahead otherwise here s the scoop the ipad is a touch-screen tablet computer roughly the size of a magazine with three models that connect to the internet strictly over wi-fi 16gb for 499 32gb for 599 64gb for 699 and three that use a combination of wi-fi and at amp t s 3g wireless 16gb for 629 32gb for 729 and 64gb for 829--pay-as-you go for the data subscription the ipad runs the same software found on apple s popular iphone and ipod touch apple calls this software the iphone os and it s generally regarded as one of the most successful operating systems designed for use with touch-screen devices unlike conventional computer os software designed around the mouse and the keyboard the iphone os responds only to touch input and is generally capable of running only one application at a time if you ve ever used an iphone or ipod touch the ipad will feel immediately familiar out of the box you get many of the iphone s capabilities including apple-designed applications apps for web browsing e-mail maps photos music video youtube and more more apps can be installed using the built-in app store software or by connecting the ipad to itunes via your computer using the included cable if you already own apps purchased for an iphone or ipod touch you can transfer these apps to the ipad as well compared with the iphone shown right the ipad offers a substantially larger screen for browsing the web design apple rarely skimps on design and the ipad is no exception the screen is made of the same oleophobic-coated glass as the iphone 3gs making it relatively easy to wipe away the fingerprints and smudges it inevitably collects behind the glass is an led-backlit 9.7-inch capacitive touch screen that uses ips in-plane switching technology for above-average viewing angles below the screen sits a home button that looks and behaves exactly like the one on the iphone and ipod touch bouncing you out of any open app and placing you back in the main menu matte aluminum wraps around the backs and sides of the ipad tapering a bit around the edges if you ve ever held one of apple s unibody macbooks you know exactly the kind of feel and finish of the ipad s aluminum unlike the polished chrome of the ipod or glossy plastic of the iphone the back of the ipad seems less likely to show wear of course--as with any apple product--there are already hundreds of cases for the ipad should you feel the need to give it extra protection the ipad measures 7.47 inches wide by 9.56 inches tall by 0.5 inch thick and weighs 1.5 pounds or 1.6 pounds for the 3g model held in your hands the dimensions and heft have a natural magazine-like feel like the iphone and ipod touch the ipad sports a finger-friendly os with an onscreen qwerty keyboard and an accelerometer that can detect whether the device is in portrait or landscape mode the buttons switches and ports around the edges of the ipad also mimic those of the iphone a 30-pin dock connector sits on the bottom along with a small integrated speaker on the right edge you have a volume rocker and a switch that works to mute any intrusive alert sounds such as the chime of an incoming e-mail or a game center friend request the ipad s refined feel and high-quality materials won t surprise apple devotees but in the larger landscape of tablets netbook computers and e-readers the design feels distinctly upscale--especially given its price next to the asus eee pc amazon kindle or fusion garage joojoo the ipad looks like it was made on a different planet where plastic doesn t exist we don t make the point to be snobby but looks matter considering that all these devices are marketed as living-room accessories size also matters as one of the first tablet computers to go mainstream you ll need to assess the ipad s size on a case-by-case basis for the advertised purposes of web browsing reading books and checking your e-mail we found the magazine-size screen perfectly adequate after years of watching videos on devices like the ipod touch or even dedicated video players like the archos 5 video playback on the ipad s 9.7-inch screen feels downright luxurious for all its charms however the ipad is not as portable as we d like part of the problem is psychological logically you know the ipad s dimensions are no less portable than a book but when a book costs between 500 and 800 and is made of glass you treat it differently without being tucked away in a messenger bag or protective case walking outside with an ipad in your hand feels like slapping the laws of gravity in the face we d also be lying if we didn t say we wish the ipad could be a little thinner and lighter at 1.5 pounds and half an inch thick it makes most netbooks look bloated but he ipad is slightly heavier and thicker than most dedicated e-book readers including the relatively large kindle dx if your dream is to relax in a hammock with an e-book in one hand and a tropical drink in the other plan to avoid the ipad s glass screen hurtling toward your face when you doze off ios unlike many of the tablet-style devices we ve encountered the ipad doesn t run a conventional os operating system such as windows linux or mac os x instead apple decided to use the mobile version of os x from what is arguably its most successful and fastest-growing product the iphone in our view apple s use of the iphone os distinguishes the ipad from the competition as dozens of ipad alternatives come out of the woodwork touting all sorts of advantages and added features the ipad will remain the only tablet computer on the market with access to apple s app store in our view apple s use of the iphone s ios distinguishes the ipad from the competition you don t need to worry about traditional computer headaches such as scattered files on your desktop installing drivers for third-party hardware or trying to figure out where you put a downloaded image instead all your apps are clearly laid out organized in a grid of nickel-size icons that respond to a single touch if you download an image from a web page or e-mail it appears in your photo library without fail if you need to search for anything--a song an e-mail a photo or a web page--double-clicking the home button brings up a spotlight search feature that covers just about everything on the device on the ipad the organizational metaphor of the folder does not exist and the effect feels liberating for the most part the iphone s ios feels like a natural fit for a device like this some of you however will probably feel suffocated by apple s totalitarian control over the ipad s os purchasing software and media on the device makes apple s walled-garden approach to the iphone os frustrating to a wider audience the only way for users to purchase and download movies and music on the ipad is to use apple s integrated itunes store if you want to buy new software for the device you ll need to go through apple s integrated app store which displays only applications deemed acceptable by apple compared with the more laissez-faire approach of a windows netbook for example the ipad user is giving away freedom of choice in exchange for convenience one upside in theory apple s top-down control over the iphone os and the commerce within it also serves to minimize the ipad s vulnerability to computer viruses with the free ios 4.2 update apple rolled out in november 2010 the ipad gains several new features that were previously only available to iphone 4 and ipod touch users the most notable new additions include app multitasking a universal e-mail inbox threaded e-mail messages and home screen folders other significant improvements include support for apple s new airplay wireless streaming standard compatible with apple tv itunes and select models of compatible third-party speakers and airprint a method for printing documents to compatible printers using apps such as safari photos email iworks and others for gaming fans the updated os also brings apple s game center app which allows you to track your game scores and achievements and set up multiplayer games with friends or strangers all in all the update offers many improvements to the already excellent product without any noticeable sacrifices in performance or reliability everything old is new again you can t place calls with the ipad at least not without a voip app or easily text message your friends but the other built-in capabilities are essentially the same as those on the iphone 4 that said the ipad can be pushed much further than any nonlaptop mobile device we ve tested including the iphone because of the ipad s extra screen size default apps such as the safari web browser e-mail ipod video maps photos and youtube all look and behave much more like full-blown applications the ipad s e-mail app for example is a doppelganger for the mail application in apple os x offering an overview of your in-box alongside the text of any currently selected message the photos app could easily be mistaken for apple s iphoto with its opening view of photos arranged in event-specific stacks the ipod app looks and behaves like an abbreviated version of itunes for better or worse and the youtube app plays out like a prettier version of the actual web site paradoxically the two apps that have changed the least maps and the safari browser give the most radically different experience thanks to the ipad s big screen size is meaningless without grace luckily the ipad has both qualities in equal measure helped by a new 1ghz apple a4 processor capacitive multitouch display technology and an integrated wi-fi antenna compatible with the latest 802.1n wireless spec apps launch within seconds waking from sleep mode is nearly instantaneous and even a cold boot-up takes just 18 seconds even if your local wi-fi network isn t up to 802.11n speeds the web-browsing experience often feels faster than on an iphone or ipod touch on the same network simply because you re doing a lot less scrolling and zooming to get to the information you need other hardware features include bluetooth 2.1 a stereo audio output headphone jack a built-in speaker an integrated lithium ion rechargeable battery nand flash memory an integrated accelerometer tilt sensor and an ambient light sensor apple s third-generation ipod touch can claim many of the same features but lacks the ipad s integrated digital compass built-in microphone and mute switch it s also worth noting that the ipad s speaker is noticeably louder than the speaker included on the iphone and ipod touch with a slightly beefier sound though still ugly to listen to apple doesn t include earbuds with the ipad so do yourself a favor and treat yourself to a nice pair a 3g wireless-compatible version of the ipad is also available which includes a sim card tray as well as assisted gps capabilities bluetooth just like the iphone 3gs and ipod touch the ipad includes wireless bluetooth audio capabilities we tested the ipad with an altec lansing backbeat stereo bluetooth headset and the audio quality was on par with results from the third-generation ipod touch the pairing process was easy and incident-free in the music player a small bluetooth icon appears next to the player controls and toggles audio back and forth between the speaker and the headset the ipad s bluetooth capabilities also allow peer-to-peer networking for gaming and wireless keyboard support for compatible writing applications itunes store and app store in the same way the ipad s apps all look and behave much more like apple s full-blown os x applications the ipad s integrated itunes store could easily be mistaken for the desktop itunes store size aside all the same capabilities are here including movie rentals and purchases tv show downloads audiobooks and access to itunes u you can pay for purchases by setting up an itunes account with a credit card or by redeeming itunes gift cards the same can be said for the ipad version of the app store it looks and acts more like the store experience within apple s itunes software because the app store is running on the ipad however the default display will bring up apps that are optimized specifically for the ipad apple is encouraging developers to create new apps specifically for the ipad which are not necessarily backward-compatible with the iphone or ipod touch because this is potentially an expensive proposition for users we would like it to be easier to distinguish between an app designed for the iphone and the same app designed for the ipad there are dual-compatibility apps on offer that include both ipad versions and iphone versions embedded within the same file which apple specially designates with a symbol within the ipad app store we wish more apps were bundled this way to ensure broad compatibility but we understand there s more money to be made in selling apps separately fortunately in the world of apps the ipad is at the top of the food chain most apps designed for the iphone or touch can run on the ipad either scaled-up to fit the screen or presented at their original resolution framed at the center of the screen in black this capability is good news for anyone bringing their existing apps over from an iphone or ipod touch although users will likely want to purchase separate ipad-optimized versions of the apps they use regularly which could get pricey accessories beyond the deluge of third-party accessories already hitting store shelves apple is offering a handful of its own accessories for the ipad including a physical keyboard with an integrated dock 69 a charging dock without the keyboard 29 that engages the ipad s photo frame mode a camera connection kit 30 that includes both a usb and an sd card adapter for importing images from a digital camera and a wrap-around leather case 40 that doubles as a kickstand if you re interested in using the ipad for presentations apple offers a 30 vga adapter that can connect to a projector or computer monitor video output is only compatible with specific apps such as apple s keynote the maximum output resolution is only 1 024x768 pixels so keep your hd expectations in check that said with the arrival of ios 4.2 and its airplay capabilities ipad owners can now send hd resolution video and multichannel audio wirelessly to apple s latest apple tv media receiver in addition to music streaming and photo slideshows for more details read our full review of apple tv as far as essential accessories go we believe a protective case of some kind is a good investment also given the alternative of charging the ipad using a basic wall adapter 29 seems a fair price for a charging dock that transforms an otherwise techy device into an attractive digital photo frame requirements though the ipad can be used without a computer most of the time you will need to connect to a computer running apple s itunes 9.1 or later to set up the device and sync any existing media contacts e-mail photos or browser bookmarks computer specification requirements for itunes 9.1 can be found on apple s web site if you plan to use the ipad at home for surfing the web and you don t have a 3g-capable model you will need to make sure your home is set up for wireless internet continue to next page 1 2 editors top picks 1 apple

down close if sbn.openx.istablet else a review of the new 13-inch macbook pro with retina display so closely following a review of the 15-inch model has many layers in isolation the 13-inch pro is just a smaller version of its well-regarded bigger brother and so it s easy to set expectations but more broadly the new 13-inch pro is much more than that it s a logical endpoint for a number of apple and tech industry trend lines and the start of a new wave altogether it s a mainstream laptop that uses all the space-saving tricks and techniques apple learned building the macbook air to be as thin and light as possible but still offers up a powerful intel processor and a seven-hour battery life the design language follows right along with the recently-introduced 15-inch retina macbook pro which itself was a subtle iteration on the macbook pro before it and it has that retina display a technology that remains unmatched in the pc market none of this is surprising but that s not a bad thing the 13-inch pro is a predictable product in the same way that opening a present and receiving exactly the thing you d wished for is a predictable experience apple has a playbook and the new 13-inch pro follows it closely and as apple s most popular mac the 13-inch pro tells us a lot about what apple thinks mainstream computers should look like which usually tells us a lot about what other pc manufacturers will think mainstream computers should look like but now that we ve unwrapped this thing does it live up to all these expectations can its relatively midrange internals handle the burden of that beautiful display is the 1 699 13-inch pro worth the upgrade over the 1 199 13-inch air until now the laptop we ve most often recommended most importantly is this your next laptop

previous next jdocument.readyfunction j gallery3350067 .gallery unlike the 15-inch retina macbook pro the size and weight reduction of the 13-inch pro isn t nearly as shocking in person the older 13-inch pro already felt quite small and the ubiquitous 13-inch air is just slightly thinner at its thickest point and the air is actually a little bigger in terms of height and width basically you re used to apple making laptops of about this size and the retina 13 is a nice midpoint between the old pro and the air dimensions in thickness in weight lbs macbook pro with retina display 13-inch 12.35

improvement in apple s already industry-leading fit and finish though the 13 uses the same new riff on unibody macbook design as the 15-inch retina and it s an extremely stiff solid machine it s also extremely clean with no branding on it apart from the apple logo on the lid and the regulatory stuff on the bottom even the macbook pro insignia under the screen has been done away with and the little indent in front of the trackpad has been slightly smoothed out and made less concave everything s just a little tighter than before the backlit keyboard and glass multitouch trackpad are up to apple s usual high standards although if you re coming to the pro from an air you ll notice the increased key travel apple employs on pro machines around the left side you ll find the new thinner magsafe 2 power connector two thunderbolt ports a usb 3.0 port and a headphone jack on the right there s another usb 3.0 port an hdmi port and an sd card slot it s a nice improvement over the previous arrangement that had all the ports crammed up on one side and the hdmi jack is particularly welcome it s the first industry-standard video connector apple s built into a laptop in years and i m hoping it supplants vga.. sometime and you can obviously still use mini displayport cables and adapters with the thunderbolt ports if you have an existing display or projector do keep in mind that the reduced size means you re losing ethernet firewire and an optical drive the vast majority of people probably won t miss them but if you re a traveler you ll probably want to spring for the 29.99 thunderbolt-to-ethernet adapter in case of emergencies retina display retina display this is what computer screens should look like from now on there are no superlatives left for apple s retina displays the company is leading the industry in shipping ultra-high-resolution screens and building software to take advantage of them and while others are starting to catch up on smartphones and tablets there s simply no match in the laptop world this is what computers should look like from now on apple s basic trick is a simple one where a traditional display has a single pixel a retina display has four but the extra pixels are used to make everything sharper not provide more screen real estate quadrupling pixel density in this way means the retina 13 has a 226ppi 2560 x 1600 display where the previous pro had a 113ppi 1280 x 800 display but the effective screen area at the default best setting is still 1280 x 800 put more simply you re seeing the same amount of stuff out of the box as the previous 13-inch macbook pro but assuming you re looking at a retina-enhanced app you re seeing it far more beautifully living in a retina world the good news is that lots of apps have been retina-enhanced since the 15-inch pro came out all of apple s pro and consumer apps are enhanced of course and major apps like office chrome and adobe premiere have all been updated in the past few months adobe s also promised an update for many other apps including photoshop cs6 and lightroom in the fall and apple maintains an entire section of retina-enhanced apps in the mac app store if you re looking for more with indie favorites like evernote day one pixelmator and tweetbot all offering support the bad news is things can look like garbage if you re not looking at retina-enhanced content the now-deprecated twitter app is probably the most egregious example it looks so blurry and out of place on this display that it s just sad and while web browsers like chrome and safari have been updated for the retina display the web itself is still catching up you ll notice blurry low-res images everywhere and sites like facebook and youtube that mix retina-enhanced text and icons with standard assets look fairly messy things are improving rapidly but for now potential retina owners should take a note from victor ward the better you look the more you see lastly it s important to note that 1280 x 800 isn t actually a huge amount of screen real estate it s about the same as the standard 13-inch windows laptop resolution of 1366 x 768 but it s noticeably smaller than the 1440 x 900 on a macbook air everything is far more beautiful at the retina setting on the 13-inch pro but you ll have less working space than you might be used to you can go into the display options and switch to 1440 x 900 which still looks nice but you lose a hair of retina crispness since you re scaling to a non-native resolution think about it this way where the retina best setting fits each pixel of a 1280 x 800 image perfectly onto four pixels of a 2560 x 1600 screen each pixel of a 1440 x 900 image fits imperfectly onto 3.6 pixels of the display so it s a little bit blurrier you might not notice it but it still isn t what you re paying for and running at higher resolutions imparts a performance penalty which isn t good news on this machine more on that in a bit you can also set the display to a max of 1680 x 1050 which i was very excited about since that s the same workspace as my older 15-inch pro but it s just too tiny for my eyes overall the 13-inch retina display stands alongside the 15-inch as one of the best displays to ever ship on a laptop but the simple fact is that i never used the best retina setting and instead left it at 1440 x 900 the good news is that the technology is improving quickly google and samsung are already shipping a 300ppi 10-inch display on the nexus 10 at the same resolution as this 13-inch retina macbook pro apple just has to find a way to ship 255ppi displays a 2880 x 1800 13.3-inch display on the 13-inch macbook pro would run natively at 1440 x 900 and a 3360 x 2100 15.6-inch display on the 15-inch pro would run natively at 1680 x 1050 but for now the 13-inch pro offers a tiny beautiful window onto a tragically imperfect world unfortunately that gorgeous face is often betrayed by a rather pedestrian mind the better you look the more you see performance performance and battery life the 2.5ghz core i5 in the 13-inch pro offers terrific raw cpu performance in benchmarks running geekbench at a solid 6700-6800 range but the integrated intel hd 4000 graphics chip can struggle driving such a high-resolution display oddly it showed up for me more during day-to-day usage than under any crazy test situation i came up with raw files in aperture scroll around just fine while quicktime is playing back 1080p movie trailers but safari and chrome both stutter a little while scrolling simple web pages and they stutter a lot with image-heavy sites like the verge and polygon you ll also notice some general lag when you start multitasking heavily open more than a few tabs and apps and you ll start to notice things slowing down around the system as a whole my standard workday set of 15-20 tabs open in chrome music playing in spotify email and irc open and skype iphoto and messages running in the background never pegged the cpu meter but i could clearly feel the system running just a hair behind me you might not notice it if you re coming from an air or a much older macbook but i m used to my 15-inch pro with 2.3ghz core i7 and radeon hd 6750m graphics and and the 13-inch retina is definitely a little slower if you re a pro looking to step down to a smaller machine you ll almost certainly notice the performance dropoff as well the simple fact is that retina display is a lot of pixels to push around for that graphics chip just consider that apple uses the same gpu in the macbook air which has a third of the pixels and can still be made to drop frames under heavy multitasking loads plug in an external monitor and you ll feel the hit come even quicker in day-to-day use i tried both my 1080p tv over hdmi and my 24-inch 1920 x 1080 display over mini displayport and i could make youtube videos stutter on one display simply by loading the verge in the other the graphics chip struggles to drive that display if you re expecting your investment to last a few years look elsewhere in terms of gaming performance there isn t much a newer heavier game like the witcher 2 assassins of kings was absolutely unplayable i couldn t even watch the opening cutscene and there was so much input lag it took me a few tries to get the mouse arrow onto the quit menu to stop the pain things are passable if you stick to older games but nothing to write home about i generally saw 60fps and under running half-life 2 episode 2 at 1280 x 800 and default settings and rarely saw it go past 90fps setting it to 1680 x 1050 meant i never saw anything more than 45fps portal 2 comes capped at 60fps at the default settings but i spent most of my time at around 50fps and turning off the cap didn t do much the base 1 699 configuration gives you 8gb of ram and a 128gb ssd that s it forever neither is easily upgradeable and you can t order a 13-inch with 16gb of ram as you can with the 15-inch pro and a 128gb hard drive is not a lot of storage especially for a primary machine the 128gb ssd in my work laptop is always running close to full and i barely keep any music or photos on it at all upgrading to a 256gb drive will run you another 300 for a total of 1 999 at which point you should bite the bullet and spend 2 199 on a 15-inch retina macbook pro that offers the same storage space a higher screen resolution a faster core i7 processor and a discrete gpu that does a far better job of moving all those pixels around it is an absolutely huge increase in performance for an extra 10 percent in cost no one should buy the 1 999 13-inch pro with the 15-inch model sitting right there ultimately it feels like the 13-inch pro is already pushing up against the edge of its performance envelope it ll probably be fine if you re a pro who absolutely needs the beautiful display and you upgrade frequently but if you re expecting your 1 699 investment to last a few years you should look elsewhere and if you re thinking about spending 1 999 on the model with more storage you should find a way to buy the 15-inch retina pro instead battery life battery life was surprisingly decent on the 13-inch pro clocking in at 6 hours and 18 minutes on the verge battery test which cycles through a series of websites over wi-fi at 65 percent brightness in more general use i routinely got around 5.5 hours just going about my daily routine without regard for battery life that compares favorably to the air which gets close to 7 hours on our test and usually runs for about 5.5 to 6 hours in daily use and it s much better than the 15-inch retina pro which only ran for 5 hours in our test you re essentially sacrificing a little of the air s battery life to run the display and slightly beefier processor it s not a terrible tradeoff but you should be aware of it wrap-up compare it apple macbook pro with retina display 13-inch 7.8 verge score write review good stuff stunning display solid battery life impressive size and weight bad stuff strained performance smaller usable screen area than macbook air at retina setting only 128gb of storage a tantalizing glimpse of the future limited by the reality of the present i spent the entire time i was reviewing the 13-inch macbook pro with retina display thinking about the macbook air not the current air which has become the best overall laptop on the market but the very first air the one from 2008 that was ridiculously underpowered featured terrible integrated intel graphics had just 2gb of ram and an 80gb hard drive and cost an absurd 1 799 i know people who bought that computer and felt an immediate combination of intense love and deep regret while it was blindingly clear that all laptops would be that thin and beautiful in the future it was equally clear that apple was too far ahead of the performance curve in the present four years later the air has become apple s mainstream product and the pc industry is still working to catch up the curve has flattened out it s the same thing with the 13-inch pro it s hard not to love this thing when you first see it just look at that screen but you re paying a lot of money for a computer that once again offers a single tantalizing glimpse of the future only to be limited by the realities of the present in almost every other way one day all computer displays will look this good one day we ll sit around campfires drinking moonshine and telling our children nightmare tales of visible pixels and display resolutions under 200ppi that day will be wonderful it will also have a reasonable

turned it into a sleek modern laptop sitting at the midway point between slim ultrabook and mainstream powerhouse prior to this the 1 199 13-inch macbook air had become apple s go-to for everyday consumers while the recent 15-inch macbook pro with retina display was the 2 199 reach system for power users even though the standard 13-inch pro starting at 1 199 remains a strong seller for apple it has also become the most archaic-feeling apple laptop saddled with a low native screen resolution and a chunky by contemporary ultrabook standards body at a starting price of 1 699 the new 13-inch macbook pro with retina display is a big step up in price from apple s other 13-inch laptops but it also offers features they cannot like the 15-inch retina pro this new model includes a high-resolution display -- at 2 560x1 600 pixels it s the highest resolution you can get in a 13-inch laptop -- plus two thunderbolt/displayport outputs and even hdmi this update is not as revolutionary as the 15-inch version which really was something we had never seen before but it leapfrogs some recent windows 8 ultrabook-style laptops that were giving the macbook air serious competition as the go-to premium laptop in that price range such as the acer aspire s7 and the dell xps 12 is 1 699 too much to ask for a 13-inch laptop i ve recently seen some flagship windows 8 laptop with similar prices the aforementioned acer aspire s7 is 1 649 but that includes a low-voltage core i7 and a 256gb ssd the convertible dell xps 12 with a slightly smaller 12.5-inch screen starts at 1 199 but our review unit of that system also traded up to a core i7/256gb ssd combo for 1 699 both of those laptops have 1 920x1 080-pixel displays which is as high as you can get on a consumer windows laptop and both are touch-screen laptops an area apple has yet to get into compared with those the base model retina 13-inch pro has a core i5 and 128gb ssd the unit we re testing is actually the step-up model which upgrades the storage space to 256gb for a total of 1 999 add a core i7 processor to that and it s 2 199 -- the same price as the 15-inch retina pro with a core i7 256gb ssd and discrete nvidia graphics the takeaway none of these superpremium laptops is inexpensive and at 1 199 1 699 or 2 199 you have several options depending on your need for storage space screen size cpu power or graphics the main selling point of this system the retina display is something that presents itself much better in person than online like the 15-inch version this won t actually look like you re seeing full 2 560x1 600-pixel resolution or 2 880x 1800 pixels in the case of the 15-inch if you still think about screen resolution in the same way windows laptops do instead apple uses a different dot pitch for the screen which makes the desktop appear to be operating at 1 280x800 pixels just with a much finer grain to the image you can pop into the system preferences menu and change that to look like 1 440x900 pixels or 1 680x1 050 pixels the end result is a screen that s higher-res than a 1 920x1 080-pixel laptop but appears to operate at a lower screen resolution all while appearing crisper and sharper if all that sounds confusing just know that you re unlikely to notice the difference between a retina and non-retina screen until you see them side by side then it s definitely noticeable but i ve found it primarily of use in reading onscreen text more than anything else the same was true for the retina ipad versus previous non-retina ipads the retina macbook pro is on the right a 13-inch air on the left interestingly the non-retina 13-inch and 15-inch macbook pro laptops continue to exist although it s hard to imagine anyone not needing an internal optical drive or huge hdd going to those as a first choice a budget-driven choice perhaps while we continue to test the new 13-inch macbook pro with retina display my initial impression is of a laptop following an inevitable evolutionary pathway shedding size and weight along with arguably legacy hardware from optical drives to platter hard drives to ethernet jacks a point sure to be hotly disputed by those who still use those features every day i d still call the 15-inch retina pro the best all-around macbook in apple s current roster and the 13-inch air the most practical for on-the-go lifestyles that puts this model just behind those in the complex calculation of value practicality and features but still miles ahead of most other 13-inch laptops table.geekbox th

current-gen 13-inch macbook air the results left me feeling that each design has its advantages but there s still a big difference between the two while the new retina macbook pro is not as thin and light as a macbook air it actually has a slightly smaller footprint the retina pro is 12.4 inches by 8.6 inches whereas the 13-inch air measures 12.8 inches by 8.9 inches i know plenty of people who lug around full-size 13-inch macbook pros to and from work everyday -- and a few who do the same with 15-inch models both camps would benefit greatly from the smaller retina pro some time ago i decided to carry a 15-inch retina pro around with me every day for a week as a test it ended up being much easier to travel with than i expected so the 13-inch model could certainly be an everyday machine although many ultrabooks and the macbook air clock in at around half a pound less the keyboard and trackpad are the same as seen on the last several generations of macbook and they remain an industry standard other laptops have matched but not surpassed the backlit apple keyboard and the trackpad with its multifinger gestures remains the easiest to use in any laptop -- although windows 8 is making a major play for improved touch-pad gestures on the 15-inch retina pro the high-res display felt like a real hardware breakthrough since then we haven t seen anything like it on any other laptop until now although the same higher-res technology can be found in recent iphone and ipad models adding it to this 13.3-inch model doesn t yield results that are quite as stunning but even on this smaller scale colors pop images appear to have great depth and text is much crisper than on any non-retina laptop apple says this screen has less glare than previous macbook screens -- the glossy top layer still seemed to reflect plenty of light from nearby sources the retina pro sticks with a 16 10 aspect ratio the much more common 16 9 aspect ratio is only found in the 11-inch macbook air it won t make a tremendous amount of difference but there s something to be said for matching the aspect ratio of hd television content for letterbox-bar-free viewing table.geekbox th table.geekbox

its way to replace the ultra-premium tier with something even more covetous namely a 15-inch macbook pro with such a pixel-dense screen that the company put retina display prominently in its name apple went even further shrinking the body down to as thin as air dimensions thanks to some clever industrial design and a few sacrifices along the way and that s without skimping on processing power

the most impressive feat is how small and light the macbook pro with retina is at .71 inches thick uniformly the macbook pro with retina display is just a hair taller than the .68-inch at its thickest macbook air though in practice we found the air to stand actually a little taller on a table when side-to-side because of the shorter rubber feet on the bottom of the new generation pro compared to the traditional 15-inch macbook pro the retina model is about 25 percent lighter 4.46 vs 5.6 pounds with about 37 percent less volumetric footprint while most of that is due to the thickness all dimensions have shrunk a hair and that smaller bezel also means we lose macbook pro branding on the front both of which we like it ll feel a little bit better than the pro models when carrying it

outside of the keyboard inset otherwise both the keyboard and trackpad feel the same as the old pro which is a good thing as those are still some of the best in the laptop industry both very clicky and responsive one last thing about the front and this may seem weird the front indentation you use for getting your finger under the lid to open the case is much less rough than past versions as someone who often rests a thumb in that groove this really does matter i don t remember you lookin any better besides the keyboard layout not size another design choice thankfully brought over from the air is ports on both side of the machine whereas the traditional pro crowds pretty much everything on the left edge the retina model splits up the usb 3.0 ports one on each side also along the left we have two thunderbolt ports so much daisy chaining a headphone jack and the new magsafe 2 adapter think of it as a flatter version of the original t-shaped magsafe that is it s worth noting not compatible with previous macbook laptops and vice-versa apple sells a magsafe-to-magsafe 2 convertor that ll let you use your old 85w brick but as of this writing there s nothing to help original magsafe-compatible macbooks work with the new adaptors and this won t be unique to the now-flagship laptop the 2012 macbook air also uses magsafe 2 while the non-retina macbook pro still uses the original the aesthetic improvement is subtle and debatable to an extent there s a debate in the office over this t connector versus the more recent 90-degree l connector with the cord going straight backwards but we ultimately do prefer being able to unplug by pulling in any of the four directions on the right side of the macbook pro with retina display we ve got the sdxc slot a usb 3.0 port and hdmi out hdmi is a particularly useful addition and it s great for plugging both video and audio remember to toggle via system preferences gt sound into a tv with just one cable by default we were mirroring our own display which subsequently letterboxed the laptop screen into a 16 9 aspect ratio but it can also work as an independent second display with its own color profile as for that sdxc slot apple s still having cards stick partially out of the machine a design choice we ve come to accept but would really rather have it hide more flush with with the frame getting the new generation mbp down to a .71-inch frame also meant cutting some ports so let s run through what s gone ethernet firewire and an optical drive apple s been pushing a disc-less existence for some time the original air dropped it in lieu of a usb-powered external drive now listed as for all macs without optical drives os x now allows for remote disc use via another computer and the app store conveniently serves both production-level apps and even entire os x updates like mountain lion as for the others apple is currently selling a thunderbolt-to-gigabit ethernet adapter for 29.99 and at wwdc the company announced plans to release a similar dongle for firewire 800 oh and before we forget the one-button battery indicator on the front left edge of pro models gone sad for those that liked using it to check the charge mid-game or while the laptop was in a bag inconsequential to everyone else retina display retina display today i finally overcame trying to fit the world inside a picture frame we ll forgive you if this is the first part of the review you jumped to after all the retina display is now apple s single unified design choice across nearly all its screens iphone ipad and now macbook still no imac although at 21.5 and 27 inches there are probably some technical limitations to still work out there by the numbers the new macbook pro with retina display boasts a 15.4-inch 2880 x 1800 display its 5.18 million pixels is quadruple the resolution of last-generation s baseline 1440 x 900 macbook pro and even a huge leap over the previous high-res option at 1680 x 1050 it s an important number to remember when we compare it to the non-retina macbook pros the aforementioned last-gen 15.4-inch screens had between 1.3 and 1.76 megapixels while the 17-inch had a 2.3-megapixel screen 1920 x 1200 despite its extra physical real estate pixel density for the retina display is around 220ppi for perspective the sony vaio z s 13.1-inch 1080p 1920 x 1080 screen is about 168ppi it doesn t quite match the density of the 9.7-inch new ipad 263ppi or 3.5-inch iphone 4 / 4s 326ppi but as apple likes to say you re probably holding your laptop a bit farther away so it still falls under the range of retina status meaning your eyes can t discern individual pixels it s close to impossible and after hours of squinting at a safari page we gave up take for example textedit since icons go up to 1024 x 1024 you can now read what s actually scribbled on the paper in the icon stay foolish squinter the other number worth mentioning here is the touted 178-degree viewing angle which which means you can see the screen from basically anywhere unless you re staring at the edge while we haven t measured it qualitatively we were incredibly impressed by how clear text was at very extreme horizontal and vertical viewing angles although glare became an issue well before then web browser as of this writing safari is the only one of the big four browsers the others being chrome firefox and opera to support retina text and the difference is striking it s at once a compliment to the improved hardware and a reason for early adopters to hesitate on purchasing side-by-side the same text is noticeably more pixelated for non-safari browsers thankfully google docs looks great but again only in safari we expect these issue to be fixed in future app updates more on that later what concerns us more however is the web itself just like with the third-generation ipad if you re surfing the web with the new macbook pro you may notice just how low-quality a lot of the images are the exception is apple.com which actually loads a different top image when you re using safari an 1860 1242 hero_2x.jpg vs the 930 621 hero.jpg for any other browser on the new macbook pro it s actually the same image that shows up when using the new ipad with retina display but that s not default behavior the retina-enhanced google.com logo for example shows up in the new ipad s browser but not in the new generation macbook pro s safari and then there s the apple store itself that logo is not retina-optimized nor are the product thumbnails images without sharp edges or text shouldn t generally be a bother but outside of scaling text it s going to be awhile before the rest of the web s assets catch up apps apple s own software including professional apps like aperture and final cut pro x as well as the ilife suite have already been optimized for the new retina display full-screen aperture in fact is just stunning the details you can see on each picture has impressed everyone we ve shown same goes for iphoto and preview the retina-optimized final cut pro x also benefits by being able to show a full 1080p video while still leaving room for all controls but like the transition from ipad 2 to new ipad third-party developers still need to update their apps to work in the new more pixel-dense environment and as we alluded to earlier it s the text-based apps that suffer the most a few other apps have this text issue kindle and nook being two of the more aggravating examples but we don t want to dwell too much on this as with the new ipad we suspect app developers will be fairly quick to upgrade their apps to support the new retina standard some of the notable pain points for now include kindle nook and the entire microsoft office suite all the text looks jagged and pixelated in a very grating way sparrow has a very intriguing mix of good and bad text the body text of each email is using retina-optimized text while the column view of email subject lines and all iconography is still pixelated and photoshop s toolbar is definitely in need of higher-res iconography again like the new ipad this is something we expect will be fixed over time as developers update to the new environment and text-based apps like ia writer already look gorgeous display settings apple has streamlined the display settings menu in system preference gone is a numerical list of resolutions instead we have two radio buttons best for retina display which is default and provides no further tweaking and scaled there are five levels of scale with retina in the middle you can opt for larger text that looks like 1024 x 640 but screencaps at 2048 x 1280 i.e quadruple the resolution or for more space that looks like 1920 x 1200 with an image that screencaps to 3840 x 2400 at either of those extremes the retina text still looks better than its non-retina counterparts so it s really more of a personal preference than it is a way to try and make older apps look better performance performance of course pushing more pixels on a screen requires more processing power for this review we have a two machines a higher-end 2.6ghz quad-core intel core i7 8gb ram and 512gb flash storage and the base model starts with a 2.3ghz quad-core i7 processor 8gb ram and 256gb flash storage both are very impressive in their own right both also have an intel hd graphics 4000 integrated graphics card as well as the more powerful nvidia geforce gt 650m gpu with 1gb dedicated gddr5 memory and automatic graphics switching the 650m is part of nvidia s 28nm kepler series that was just announced this past march and it s the most bang-for-the-power-consumption you ll find in nvidia s arsenal we ll talk about gaming performance more later in the review but we ran geekbench s 32-bit and 64-bit tests to get a gauge for performance comparatively geekbench notes that the best previous-generation macbook score was around 10 760 for the 17-inch model with a 2.5ghz core i7 processor so there s definitely a marked improvement in performance from the new ivy bridge chipset geekbench 32-bit 64-bit 2.6ghz 8gb ram 11 965 13 014 2.3ghz 8gb ram 11 049 11 969 so here s another way apple kept the machine so thin the only storage option is flash and the ram is now soldered to the logic board for 200 at the time of purchase you can upgrade the ram to 16gb and while you re at it feel free to boost the cpu to 2.7ghz and the flash storage to 768gb all-in-all adding 950 to the price as for the flash storage start time is fast within a second of the fastest ultrabooks we ve seen 17 seconds on average from off to login screen the laptop runs os x lion but apple is offering a free update to mountain lion when it comes out next month like we said that processing power needs to drive a screen much bigger than anything else out there so when pushed to the task how does it fare apple itself highlighted diablo 3 in its wwdc unveiling so let s start there we ran two tests one with diablo 3 at max resolution but nominal detail settings and one where we pushed the game s eye candy to the max this isn t the highest-specced retina macbook pro but with a 2.6ghz core i7 and 8gb ram we were able to enjoy a full 2880 x 1800 experience and compared to the standard macbook pro s 1440 x 900 or 1680 x 1050 it s a vastly improved visual experience but that isn t all that matters with gaming performance at full resolution and maxed out settings shadows physics etc we jumped between 15 and 20 frames per second just barely playable at most times but on higher difficulties that ll prove aggravating if you want to keep all the settings on max jumping down to 1680 x 1050 same as standard macbook pro gave us a consistent 30fps and is still very playable but let s be honest if you re buying this laptop you re wanting to push the upper limit of resolution more than anything as for the more slow-paced civilization v if you can read the small-but-very-legible text playing max resolution is great on the other end of the spectrum the twitch-puzzle-shooter portal 2 recommended a much smaller 1280 x 800 resolution for smooth 60fps but so long as we didn t try to tweak the advanced video effects which all but grinds the game to a halt with 2880 x 1800 the game would still be consistently in the 50fps range with only the occasional minor stutters and blizzard s other tentpole series starcraft 2 wings of liberty clocks in at around 23fps with full resolution and extreme settings it drops during big battles though you can hit 60fps by either dropping settings to low keeping full resolution or by dropping resolution to 1680 x 1050 keeping extreme settings battery / noise / heat battery life noise and heat i don t care if we sleep at all tonight the macbook pro with retina display has a built-in 95-watt-hour lithium-polymer battery the biggest in apple s portable lineup the runner-up is 15-inch non-retina macbook pro with 77.5wh despite the larger battery apple estimates 7 hours of wireless web use same as all other 2012 macbooks except for the 11-inch air and 30 days standby time using our own battery test which visits a series of web sites and loads images with brightness set at 65 percent the 2.3ghz system lasted five hours and eight minutes it s good for a laptop this powerful but only about average for apple s lineup battery life macbook pro with retina display 5 08 macbook air 2011 13-inch 6 53 hp envy 14 spectre 5 14 dell xps 13 4 55 sony vaio z 2011 5 27 / 10 34 samsung series 9 4 16 dell xps 15z 4 36 with slice battery as for the heat and fan volume per a suggestion from marco arment instapaper creator and friend of the verge we ran cputest for 12 minutes to see just how loud and hot we could get the machine there s good news and bad news while the fan was surprisingly quiet even in an apartment with closed windows and some light traffic and rain outside i could barely hear it the heat was in the ballpark of what we d expect from our personal 2011 macbook pro which is to say hot particularly the metal rim around the u key which is about where the processor rests internally it s hard to touch for more than a few seconds configs price and configuration over the last week since apple first announced the macbook pro with retina display we ve gotten one question more than anything else is this worth the 400 premium the standard macbook pro has a 1 799 base price while the retina model starts at 2 199 at its wwdc 2012 unveiling apple itself touted the laptop as its flagship but let s breakdown the price by configuration macbook pro with retina display 15-inch processor ram storage price 2.3ghz core i7 8gb 256gb flash 2 199 2.6ghz core i7 8gb 512gb flash 2 799 2.7ghz core i7 16gb 768gb flash 3 749 macbook pro 15-inch with 1440 x 900 resolution processor ram storage price 2.3ghz core i7 4gb 500gb hdd 1 799 2.3ghz core i7 8gb 256gb ssd 2 399 2.6ghz core i7 8gb 1tb hdd 2 299 2.6ghz core i7 8gb 512gb ssd 3 099 2.7ghz core i7 8gb 512gb ssd 3 349 add 100 for 1680 x 1050 so in terms of specs alone what it really comes down to is your desire to go solid-state over the cheaper hdd option trying to match processor ram and storage the standard macbook pro comes out to be at least 200 more than its retina counterpart conversely opting for a 1tb hdd will save you 500 none of that of course takes into account the fact that you re getting a screen with four times the resolution in a smaller lighter form factor losing a disc drive and ethernet port in the process personally we re smitten with solid-state storage so choosing the retina over the pro makes a lot of sense to us it always comes around back to you wrap-up compare it apple macbook pro with retina display 15-inch 9.0 verge score 9.5 user score write review good stuff best display ever for a laptop much thinner and lighter than previous pros powerful new ivy bridge chipset usb 3.0 and hdmi out bad stuff screen still prone to glare apps and website not yet optimized for retina display chassis gets notably hot in processor-intensive situations good love is on the way regardless of your feelings towards apple generally or the new generation macbook pro with retina display specifically it s more or less a certainty that laptops all over are about to make a strong push for high-resolution displays and that s good for everyone involved not only does it drive a hardware industry forward but hopefully it pushes software developers too the more high-resolution screens on the market the more websites and applications that will be optimized for it but back to this particular machine should you buy the new macbook pro with retina display over the standard pro like we said above it really comes down to whether or not you value solid-state storage over traditional hdd or the value of a higher-resolution display for us it s the retina display for sure the only way we d recommend a standard 15-inch pro right now is if you have a strict sub- 1 800 budget or really value the extra hdd storage space or dvds looking to the future it s clear the standard macbook pro is nearing the end the company has historically had no romantic inclination towards what it views are legacy components os 9 firewire 400 and 800 disc drives hdd and the original magsafe have all fallen under or are falling under cupertino s scorched earth philosophy increasingly marginalized until they re stricken from the lineup altogether the macbook pro with retina display is already a decent value in its first generation for an apple computer anyhow and as with the macbook air we expect later generations will become more compelling in price if you re in the market for a premium os x laptop right now it s hard not to recommend the new macbook pro with retina display if however power isn t your ultimate goal may we suggest shaving a few pounds and specs for the macbook air as for everything in between those non-retina standard macbook pros well.. the writing s on the wall and of course it doesn t hurt to be even a little bit patient and wait for more apps to push retina-optimized updates if you get the macbook pro with retina display now you ll be waiting on the world to change got questions about the macbook pro with retina display come ask us in the forums the breakdown more times than not the verge score is based on the average of the subscores below however since this is a non-weighted average we reserve the right to tweak the overall score if we feel it doesn t reflect our overall assessment and price of the

00:00:00',9.2,77,' conclusion we like it the macbook pro with retina display is apple s best laptop yet and price aside is probably the most well-rounded laptop available today it has the best display available on any device -- anywhere -- and it s faster thinner and lighter than other laptops in its class however applications that haven t been updated to take advantage of its ultra-high-resolution display look awful with jagged text and fuzzy graphics and it is definitely priced for professionals that said if you can brave the sticker shock and you re willing to put up with apps not yet updated for retina displays this laptop stands alone we suspect that for most people this machine will be out of reach though which is why we feel the macbook air 13-inch still has the best balance of portability power and price of any laptop out today '),(397,'2013-04-23 05:13:02',10.0,76,'<3'),(399,'2012-06-11 00:00:00',8.4,77,' cnet editors choicejun 12 slide 2 slide 3 slide 4 slide 5 slide 6

brand-new apple laptop design is rare and always accompanied by much fanfare the new macbook pro with retina display is no exception especially as it introduces a new screen technology to laptops while pulling in influences from the macbook air existing pro and even the third-generation ipad at a starting price of 2 199 the retina macbook pro is in a different tier of product than other recently spec-bumped airs and pros but it also offers a mix of design and features that can t be duplicated in other mac laptops a quad-core processor in a body that s svelte but not quite ultrabook-thin discrete graphics a super high-res display and -- new to any macbook -- hdmi this is the biggest change to the pro s aesthetics since it adopted the now-familiar aluminum unibody construction in 2008 updated periodically with new processors and new features the macbook pro line remains a familiar sight in offices especially in creative fields and coffee shops and while that pre-existing 15-inch model is still considered thin for a midsize computer recent challenges from window-powered ultrabooks and even apple s own macbook air have clearly influenced this split in the macbook pro family tree leading to a thinner more forward-looking offshoot which will live alongside the thicker non-retina 15 and 13-inch pro laptops macbook pro with retina display hands-on pictures 1-2 of 17 scroll left scroll right note that the 2012 macbook air and pro lineups have been updated to intel s third-generation core i-series processors also known as ivy bridge and this new macbook pro with retina display starts out there as apple laptops have at times taken a while to trade up to intel s latest hardware it s nice to see ivy bridge arrive in a timely manner of course the real highlight is that new retina display its resolution is 2 880x1 800 pixels providing a level of detail never seen on a laptop before the highest standard windows laptop screen resolution is 1 920x1 080 pixels the same as an hdtv that previous high-water mark has been fine in my experience but even that can make text and images look small on a 15-inch laptop apple solves this via a different dot pitch for the screen much as it did on the third-gen ipad in person the retina display looks great although you re more likely to notice it when comparing to a non-retina laptop it ll likely be more useful for heavy readers or photoshop/final cut users at first and we ll have to see how long it takes for other popular programs to update themselves to take advantage of the new screen in the end the macbook pro with retina display while expensive is the best all-around macbook apple now makes -- unless you absolutely positively need a built-in optical drive or ethernet jack both are available via external dongles or peripherals it provides desktop-replacement-level performance but is nearly as slim as an imagined 15-inch macbook air would be even if it s a little heavier than it looks because it eclipses the previous macbook pro in many ways it earns a cnet editors choice nod still it feels like a rest stop on the road to somewhere else a not-too-distant future when all laptops are paper-thin and feather light with powerful hardware wide connectivity and generous solid-state storage that rivals bulky old platter hard drives don t be shocked to see retina screens filter down to less expensive models at some point in the not-too-distant future we re not there yet but this is a big step in that direction table.geekbox th table.geekbox tr.even .ratinggood .ratingaverage

thinner 15-inch macbook pro is both familiar and very different from what we ve seen before this is not an ultrabook or an ultrathin laptop as one would call these systems before intel invented the ultrabook term nor is it a full midsize laptop instead it s an entirely new take that skirts the two taking features from both sides of the aisle in the hand at 0.7 inch it s nearly as thin as a macbook air at least the thicker end of that tapered system but it s heavier than it looks closer to a pro at 4.6 pounds in other words this is not the ultimate mobile laptop for people who have to jog around from place to place all day long five or more days per week new macbook pro unboxed at always on still it feels like a nice shift from the current pro which is what i d call a carry it around twice per week tops laptop more often than that especially with the traditional 15-inch macbook pro and it really drags you down i could see carrying this new thinner pro around with you several days per week or maybe to and from work on a daily subway commute at a stretch from a distance this could be mistaken for an air but up close it s a different story the design of the speakers on either side of the keyboard is lifted from the macbook pro along with the slablike non-tapered body i d say the new pro leans 70/30 or more toward the pro rather than the air in terms of design dna the keyboard and trackpad are essentially the same as seen on the last several generations of macbook which is a good thing other laptops have matched but not surpassed the backlit apple keyboard and the trackpad with its multifinger gestures remains the industry leader there are some patents secret sauce and os-level sleight of hand behind this but the practical result is touchpad experience far

nuts for the company s products it even feels similar to previous models in your hand though it s noticeably thinner and lighter 4.46 pounds versus 5.6 pounds if you ve held a 13-inch macbook air you re not too far off view all 18 photos in gallery the 15.4-inch screen now looks more seamless if that s possible the bezel around it is black but unlike on the macbook air it s of a piece with the screen glass the screen electronics are built into the glass which helps the laptop s thin profile apple mentioned that the screen is less prone to glare than was the case with previous macbooks but the glare is still visible when you re viewing a black background and if you re really picky if you want a matte-finish screen for now you ll have to go with the updated macbook pro with ivy bridge the retina display itself is glorious the resolution is 2 880 by 1 800 which sounds like a lot but text is scaled so it doesn t look too small instead of making the letters smaller like on the iphone 4 or 4s to see this effect use one to visit a non-mobile-optomized website apple kept the font sizes consistent with what you d expect in the real world and just made them smoother in contrast text on a macbook air looks smooth from your seat but the individual letters are still jaggy close up text on the new macbook pro looks smooth from both far away and close up as if it were laser printed on

images straight from your camera and they will look more like printed images than electronic ones look at a geometric form like a picket fence in front of a yellow wall and the lines look smooth not jaggy likewise a 1 920-by-1 080 hd video takes up a relatively small portion of the screen at full resolution leaving the video editor with lots of space for timelines toolbars and other interface items it s almost like having a dual 20-inch-screen setup in a 15-inch diagonal space when playing back 1080p video full screen the improved ips display exhibits rich colors deep blacks and a generally pleasant viewing experience it really is like having a large-screen hdtv you can rest on your lap if there s any drawback to the retina display it s that all of your existing mac applications will have to be updated for it kind of like what happened with the iphone 4/4s and latest ipad apple-sourced apps like safari final cut pro and aperture look terrific but non-optimized apps like google chrome will show upscaled and jaggy fonts it s a problem that s likely to go away as more developers update their programs but it s an annoyance right now the power button has moved to the upper right of the keyboard proper like it is on the macbook air the island-style keyboard has the same feel as the macbook air key travel feels shallower than the previous macbook pro the function keys match those of the macbook air which may be a hang-up for people with older-generation macbook pros particularly ones made before the advent of mission control and the launchpad in mac os x lion the backlighting is everything we expect from a macbook clearly visible in a darkened room after several straight hours of playing back video during our battery rundown test the bottom of the system was still cool to the touch demonstrating the new chassis cooling capabilties there is a full-size hdmi port on the side of the laptop the new magsafe 2 port is wider yet shorter than the previous style so you ll need an adapter for existing led cinema and apple thunderbolt displays as well as older power adapters newly purchased thunderbolt displays will come with the magsafe 2 adapter the usb 3.0 ports aren t colored blue like they are on some windows pcs but because there aren t any usb 2.0 ports on this macbook pro you won t need color coding to tell the difference copying a 1.22gb test folder from a usb 3.0 drive took 21 seconds which is half the time we needed to copy the same folder using a usb 2.0 drive on the previous macbook pro speedier drives using the thunderbolt interface are likely to be even faster two thunderbolt ports are a boon for the video editor you can connect up to 14 devices seven devices per port the system can also support at least two thunderbolt displays for more screen real estate an sdxc slot and a headphone audio jack with headset support round out the ports one thing you won t find on the new macbook pro is a dvd superdrive the optical drive has been eliminated to benefit the new profile which is 0.71 inch 18mm at the thickest point meeting the spec for 13.3-inch or smaller ultrabooks and slimmer than the 21mm requirement for 14-inch or larger ultrabooks the macbook pro is the same height as both 11- and 13-inch macbook air models at their thickest points an impressive feat the slim profile prevents apple from using ethernet and firewire 800 ports they simply won t fit if you need either you ll need to buy adapter cables at 29 each using a thunderbolt display is also an option as it has built-in firewire 800 and ethernet on the plus side the macbook pro includes 802.11a/b/g/n wi-fi with 2.4ghz and 5ghz support as well as bluetooth 4.0 so you ll be able to connect to almost any hotspot or wireless audio device the system comes with mac os x lion 10.7.4 so you ll get all the same ilife apps and familiar mac os interface systems purchased now will be eligible for a free upgrade to mac os

about the size of a squat lunch box certainly proves that point unlike the playstation 2 and the xbox which aspire to be dvd players and living-room minicomputers this is exclusively a game machine--and a fun powerful one at that offering games suited to a broad audience playback but you ll need the 30 component-video connector and an hdtv to take advantage of the superior picture quality we tried out a third-party s-video connector and found the picture to be quite sharp with titles such as metroid prime and monkey ball 2 on a standard 4 3 tv as well as an hd-ready samsung set so long as a game is optimized for the gamecube its graphics best that of the ps2 and in some cases match that of the xbox overall however the xbox offers slightly superior graphics and performance while the gamecube is a decent performer visually it lacks the big audio dynamite of digital-audio outputs this is likely another cost-cutting maneuver that can hopefully be addressed with a different cable output presently however none is available some expansion underway unlike the xbox the gamecube has neither an internal hard drive nor the promise of one in the near future instead you ll need to buy extra memory cards to save your progress in games no card is included but it is worth noting that we did like the one peripheral that ships with the system the bundled controller which fits comfortably in hands both large and small and handles well too since we first reviewed the system nintendo has delievered on its promise to take the gamecube online you can now buy either a modem adapter for dial-up connections or a broadband adapter that said the selection of online titles is rather paltry at the moment with only sega s phantasystaronline i and ii available--and you must pay an additional subscription fee to play hopefully the gamecube s list of online games will expand in 2003 however it s up to developers not nintendo to support online play for their games so some tough economic decisions are involved on a feature-for-feature level we found the gamecube slightly lacking however it is ultimately the games that will sell any system and in that respect the gamecube is well positioned for casual gamers families since nintendo has a history of franchise characters super mario brothers pokemon and the legend of zelda are just a few of the titles that will make any kid happy and it doesn t hurt that spyro and crash bandicoot have made their way over to the system as well just as important nintendo now has a major winner with metroid prime one of the top titles on any console more high-caliber games are needed but for now there s enough here to make the gamecube a tempting purchase for certain gamers--and their parents--at its 150 price point editors top picks

components inside this eight-pound box you ll find the power of a pc a 733mhz intel processor 64mb of ram and a custom nvidia graphics board the nv2a and the heart of a video game console still as nice as all that processing power is what really matter is the onscreen results video enthusiasts will appreciate that the xbox works not only with standard 4 3 tvs but with hdtvs as well if you have an hd-ready set you can set the xbox to output 480p 720p and 1 080i signals in either normal or wide-screen 16 9 aspect ratios for your games the xbox is capable of producing 1 080i images but the games themselves such as halo and dead or alive 3 haven t been optimized for that high a level yet still the images are crisp and sharp a nice complement to this visual horsepower is the fact that the xbox supports 5.1 dolby digital surround sound and deliver 256 simultaneous voice channels--previously unheard of in a game system all of this adds up to some of the richest most realistic experiences we ve yet to see in video games however to get the most out of the system you will have to spend some extra cash on optional accessories the xbox ships with composite video cables and rca audio outputs like every other game console but for improved audio and video performance you ll have to spring for the 15 advanced av pack which has an s-video connector as well as optical digital audio jacks the 20 high definition av pack offers component video connectors y pb pr plus the optical digital audio jacks and what about dvd playback well unlike the ps2 which plays dvds right out of the

newer playstation 3 with a year s head start on microsoft s xbox and nintendo s gamecube the ps2 platform has one big advantage over the competition a greater selection of quality games though the gap is quickly narrowing particularly with the xbox on top of that it doubles as a dvd player right out of the box and offers online gaming to both broadband and dial-up users via its online adaptor accessory so while it may not be the newest or the most powerful system it s certainly a safe bet home-theater flexibility the playstation 2 can stand on its side or lie flat to fit any space and once it is installed into your home theater you ll be treated to a reasonably sharp picture and high-quality sound the playstation 2 like every other console has a composite a/v cord in the box which you use to connect the console to your tv however s-video and component-video connectors are also available separately if you d like to improve the picture quality for surround-sound audio there s a built-in optical digital audio jack with recent graphics library updates the ps2 will soon support hdtv resolutions and 16 9 wide-screen setting as the xbox does one of the first games to take advantage of this higher resolution namco s tekken 4 which looks utterly amazing its graphics are even a worthy rival to those of the xbox s dead or alive 3 when compared directly to the xbox the ps2 s 128-bit emotion engine yields in-game graphics with more jagged edges people playing on an ordinary tv aren t too likely to notice those flaws but if you compare the two systems on a high-resolution hd-ready set the edges in xbox games look significantly smoother in some ways even the little nintendo gamecube graphically surpasses the ps2 luigi s mansion and rogue leader look exceedingly crisp on the cube and the animation in batman vengeance is smoother than it is in the ps2 version movie time as noted the ps2 can play dvds out of the box the gamecube s disc drive won t accommodate five-inch discs and the xbox requires the purchase of a dvd kit to unlock its dvd-playing potential but while sony makes some fine dvd players the ps2 is not a very good dvd movie machine the video image quality is passable but it has almost no picture adjustments and only rudimentary playback controls a 20 dvd remote-control kit adds many of the missing playback features beyond home-theater integration you ll find two usb plugs and one ieee 1394 a.k.a firewire and ilink port on the front as well as a port on the back for plugging in the online adaptor gran turismo 3 a-spec lets you connect up to six ps2s to an ieee 1394 hub for head-to-head racing there are also plans to support digital cameras keyboards and mice we plugged in a usb keyboard and it worked fine to input our

review of the sony psp 3000 for more details after roughly a decade at the top of the home console industry sony decided to tackle the portable system market--one heavily fortified by nintendo s game boy advance and ds sony sought to take down nintendo by adopting the tactic that made the playstation 2 such a runaway success by offering sophisticated graphically intensive games and a heavy dose of multimedia functionality the device is called the playstation portable psp and in addition to playing games of ps2 graphical quality it can play music and movies downloaded or via disc and surf the web it may not be the best handheld media product on the market and the games lack the innovation of ones on nintendo s portables but as an all-in-one device the sony psp is king of the hill from an aesthetic perspective the sony psp is a gorgeous device it s one of those gadgets you immediately want to get your hands on but vigilantly want to protect once you set it down weighing essentially the same as the nintendo ds 6.2 ounces including removable battery and measuring 6.7 by 2.9 by 0.9 inches whd the body feels well built and solid in your hand although not a lightweight it s by no means a brick nor we suspect would it be especially durable in a fall you ll want to treat the psp just as gingerly as an ipod or a palm-style pda the psp s screen is roughly the same size as the entire front face of the ipod the centerpiece of the handheld is its especially impressive 4.3-inch wide-screen display 480x272 pixels 16.77 million colors the screen is flanked by controls that will be immediately recognizable to fans of past playstations the directional keypad is to the left of the screen and the familiar square triangle circle and x buttons are to the right we dug how sony managed to include an analog joystick below the directional keypad the stick isn t raised like the analog controls on a ps2 or an xbox but it conveys that multidirectional element that gives it a joysticklike feel the analog controller located just below the four-way directional pad is surprisingly responsive in lieu of the ps2 controller s four total shoulder buttons the psp has two one per shoulder ergonomically the device is ok but not great as with most handheld gaming devices you ll have to do a little finger stretching every 15 minutes or so to keep from cramping up the psp uses sony s recently created cross media bar interface you use the directional keypad to horizontally navigate through settings photo music video game and internet icons and each section has other icons attached to it on a vertical axis all in all it s a simple and elegant way to access the psp s many features games and officially licensed movies come on sony s proprietary umd universal media disc media which are housed in protective cartridges the umd drive is grafted to the back of the unit you load it and snap it shut just as you would a camcorder the top edge also sports infrared and a usb 2.0 port that you can use to link the device to your pc or mac though no usb connection cable is included umd media slip into the back of the psp the top-facing usb port provides pc connectivity the headphone jack is at the bottom left of the unit sony s official earbud-style headphones sport an in-line remote to control basic playback the nice thing about the remote is that you can use other headphones with it not just the provided buds like apple sony has chosen to go with white headphones we re not sure why since the psp is black though an ipod-white version is available in japan one gripe since the device has a glossy finish--and is mostly black--it s a fingerprint magnet a static-free cloth should always be at the ready when using your psp and the value pack had one bundled sony s official carrying case is a padded soft case but a variety of third-party versions are also available see our list of psp accessories for more information the folks at sony tout the psp as first and foremost a gaming device but in the next breath they claim that it can do so much more billing it as the first truly integrated portable entertainment system both statements are in fact true and suffice it to say that as a portable gaming device particularly from a graphics standpoint the psp is unparalleled you re getting a miniaturized ps2 gaming experience--or close to it anyway--and sony has amassed a decent selection of titles from various game developers to show off its handheld s gaming chops beyond gaming the psp s video prowess may be its most impressive trait as we previously noted the display is a 4.3-inch tft lcd with a 480x272-pixel resolution and 16.77 million colors by comparison each of the nintendo ds s two screens has 256x192 pixels with 260 000 colors the picture quality from a umd movie such as spider-man 2 is superior to what you ll see on most portable dvd players though the majority of dvd players have significantly larger screens the only problem with video playback--and it s a big one--is that it s currently hard to watch anything but umd videos on the psp unlike sony s minidisc umd is not a recordable storage format so you ll have to store any video or music and images on a memory stick duo card the lack of affordable and recordable umds has put the format in dire straits sony is hoping to give the format a boost by bundling umds with its dvds and creating an accessory that can transfer the video to tv but it remains highly unlikely that the many studios and retailers that have jumped ship will come back thankfully getting media onto a psp is much less of a hassle than it used to be the sony media manager software lets you transfer photos music and videos from a pc to your psp with relative ease it also lets you back up your saved games and manipulate podcast feeds it s a worthwhile alternative to the bare-bones media management options with which the psp originally shipped in march 2005 but it will cost you about 25--it s not bundled with the psp fortunately there are also a wide variety of third-party and freeware software titles available many of which focus on converting existing video files to psp-friendly formats see our how to put video on your psp tutorial for one example unfortunately home brewed videos are limited to scaled-down resolutions that fail to completely exploit the psp s native 480x272 screen the exception live streaming video from sony s locationfree tv accessory this slingbox-like device lets you watch live tv on your psp while in range of any wi-fi hot spot still it s a shame that the only way to take full advantage of video on your psp is to buy umd-format movies or expensive networking accessories the psp originally came with a 32mb memory stick duo card but you ll need a much larger one for music and movies what about music well the good news is the psp plays many types of audio files without your having to convert them to sony s proprietary atrac format first--a common problem with the company s earlier mp3 devices you simply drag your audio files into the music folder on your memory stick duo card and they ll show up on the psp firmware-updated psps can play mp3s atracs wmas wavs and aac-encoded song files though not the copy-protected versions from apple s itunes music store the device supports m3u playlists but if you have your playlists in another format you ll need to find and download a converter however as basic as the psp s music player is read ipod shuffle with a screen and no autosyncing capabilities it will be adequate for many people those interested in replacing their ipod with the psp will have to deal with the lack of on-the-go playlist functionality and most important the diy storage you can get a 1gb memory stick pro duo card for about 50 while double the capacity will cost you about three times as much sony announced 4gb and 8gb memory sticks at e3 2006 but no pricing player controls can be initially tricky--the in-line remote is handy--but we like the speedy precision of the fast-forward/rewind functions as well as the undulating background graphics the psp can also display album art when it s available continue to next page

playstation 3 months of intense hype were followed by a late launch fully a year after the xbox 360 and a staggering 600 price tag for the deluxe model even worse the ps3 didn t have any real must-have exclusive titles and despite the power of its vaunted cell processor multiplatform games from third-party developers didn t look appreciably better than the respective titles on the 360 since then the company s been modifying the playstation product line to better fit the competitive market landscape as of november 2007 a bargain playstation 3 can be had for a mere 400--but that model lacks the ability to play older ps2 games if that feature is important to you you ll need to shell out an additional 100 for the deluxe 80gb playstation 3 model--or if you re lucky enough to find a 60gb version the one reviewed here we d highly recommend jumping on that as well while the 60gb version of the playstation 3 is currently being phased out of production by sony the differences between it and the 80gb model are minimal owners of ps2 games may prefer the 60gb model because of its greater compatibility with that system s games due to its internal hardware emulation instead of the 80gb s software emulation in addition to backward compatibility with many ps2 games the 500 ps3s include more usb ports and a built-in flash media reader unfortunately however the 60gb version still suffers from the same problem currently afflicting this entire generation of playstation hardware a dearth of compelling games while the console offers a handful of great exclusives warhawk resistance fall of man and heavenly sword it doesn t look like the ps3 will have some real system-sellers until 2008 and beyond when metal gear solid 4 killzone 2 gran turismo 5 and god of war iii eventually arrive plenty of excellent third-party titles exist--from assassin s creed to call of duty 4--but they re also available on the xbox 360 which in turn has a cadre of must-have titles halo 3 mass effect gears of war that aren t on the ps3 likewise the nintendo wii continues to draw away potential ps3 buyers with its cheaper hardware and more casual and broad-based approach to gaming put another way the playstation 3 still feels more like a work in progress than do the rival wii and xbox 360 still if you want to go beyond the low-res graphics on the wii and avoid the xbox 360 s notorious red ring of death the sony ps3 delivers a full-on blu-ray player network media hub and hd gaming console with a rapidly growing library of impressive titles prizefight xbox 360 vs

with spider-man 3 blu-ray movie - currently ships with motorstorm game sony has since discontinued the 20gb playstation 3 model while the 60gb version of the playstation 3 remains available sony has begun phasing it out of their product line design like the xbox 360 and nintendo wii the playstation 3 can stand vertically or lie horizontally in an av rack though because of its curved top it s not meant to have any other components resting on top of it early prototypes were shown in white and silver but the ps3 is currently available only in black the 20gb version now discontinued was all black but the larger capacity models are highlighted with a chrome trim--and there s no way to customize its look as you can with xbox 360 s interchangeable if overpriced faceplates judging from sony s recent decision to bring out the psp in more colors we don t expect the company to stick to the black-only option for too long especially since this system like the psp is a fingerprint- and smudge-magnet if you handle it at all you ll end up having to wipe it off so you ll probably just want to stick it in a rack and leave it there as for its dimensions the ps3 measures 12.8 inches wide by 3.8 inches high by 10.8 inches long which is roughly in line with the overall volume of the xbox 360 that said the ps3 does weigh a bit more--11 pounds to the 360 s 9.9 pounds including power supply--so if you re going by heft alone you re getting almost 10 percent more console most impressively there s no external power supply for the ps3 you just plug the included power cable--it s the same standard three-prong style you ll find on most desktop pcs--into the back of the unit and you re good to go for those of us who own an xbox 360 and have had to struggle with its massive brick of a power supply this seems like a remarkable feat on sony s part like the nintendo wii the ps3 has a slot-loading disc drive one obvious difference between the xbox 360 and the ps3 is the way you load media as opposed to the more typical tray loader the ps3 has a front-slot-loading blu-ray optical-disc drive which contributes to the unit s slicker appearance discs slide in and eject smoothly enough so chalk one up for the ps3 here media card readers are located beneath a flip-up door and four usb ports are nearby on the front you ll find four usb ports for connecting and charging controllers and other accessories including usb keyboards thumbdrives and the psp four ports are nice but we would have liked to have seen at least one usb port on the back for connecting peripherals such as a camera the ps eye that spoil the ps3 s otherwise clean lines by sticking obtrusively out of the front rounding out the front panel is a built-in memory card reader behind a door that supports not only memory cards from sony s entire memory stick family but compact flash and sd/mmc cards as well sorry olympus fans--there s no built-in xd support but you can still hook up your camera--or an external card reader--via usb you ll find hdmi--but no usb--on the rear panel around back is where you ll find ports for ethernet hdmi output optical digital audio output spdif and the proprietary playstation av output for analog audio and video a composite av cable ships with the unit and because it uses the same connector as the playstation 2 that system s s-video and component cables should work with it as well to get hd video you ll need component or hdmi unlike the proprietary snap-on hard drive of the xbox 360 the ps3 s 60gb internal hard drive is user replaceable with any off-the-shelf laptop drive the only caveat it uses the smaller 2.5-inch drive size which are twice--or even close to three times--as expensive as the larger 3.5-inch hard drive that goes into a desktop computer controller makeover the single controller that comes with the ps3 is very similar looking to the traditional playstation 2 dual shock gamepad but there are some notable differences for starters it s wireless you can connect as many as seven controllers via the system s built-in bluetooth which sony s claims offers a 20-meter range about 65 feet recharging the built-in battery simply requires connecting the included usb cable between the console and the controller you can continue to play as the battery juices up sony pledges 30 hours of gameplay between charges but the cable s somewhat short 5-foot length will put you right on top of the tv that said the controller has a standard mini-usb port similar to the one found on many digital cameras and pc peripherals so swapping in a longer cable--or using a usb extender--shouldn t be a problem unfortunately the battery isn t removable which means that if it dies--as inevitably it will someday--you ll have to replace the entire controller 50 if you want to play wirelessly by comparison the xbox 360 and nintendo wii controllers offer user-replaceable batteries aas or proprietary rechargeables for the 360 and aas for the wii the wireless controller recharges by connecting via the included usb cable as for the controller s design sony has made a few tweaks the l2 and r2 trigger buttons are a bit bigger and the increased depth in stroke offers players more subtle game control sony has also increased the tilting angle of the analog joysticks to give you more precise control and a wider range of motion those analog sticks are more sensitive as well the ps2 s dual shock controller had 8-bit sensitivity while the ps3 s controller has 10-bit motion detection the sixaxis controller also has a centered home button which functions much like its counterpart on the xbox 360 controller you use it to return to the console s main menu screen as well as to sync the controller to the console and start it up or shut it down wirelessly the other big upgrade on the sixaxis controller is motion sensitivity as the name indicates the controller s capable of sensing motion in six directions up down left right forward and backward game developers have incorporated it in many of the new games in one form or another for example in call of duty 3 you can arm explosives with a twist of the controller 2k s nba 2k8 also makes interesting use of the tilt feature allowing you shoot free throws by motioning a shot with your controller to be sure some implementations of the tilt sensitivity are better than others some games use of it are optional and can be switched off as we can certainly see some folks not wanting to bother with it at all clearly sony wanted to steal some of nintendo s thunder and there s no denying that the wii s motion-sensitive controllers are more central to that console s dna the wii controllers are also more sophisticated including the ability to measure actual motion spatial movement and acceleration rather than just tilting--but unlike the wii the ps3 doesn t require a motion-sensor bar in front of the tv the current xbox 360 controllers offer no motion sensitivity at all it s safe to say we ll see more innovative uses of the tilting sensitivity feature in future games--it definitely adds an extra level of control when flying the eponymous attack vehicle in warhawk on the other hand the highly touted lair is widely considered unplayable thanks to a poorly implemented sixaxis control scheme the forthcoming dual shock 3 controller available 2008 will include the rumble feature missing on the included sixaxis controller the big omission is force feedback support the current iteration of the ps3 controller offers no vibration or rumble control however sony recently announced that a new rumbling dual shock 3 controller will be available in early 2008 in addition a large portion of existing games will be able to make use of the force feedback simply by downloading a patch sounds great--until you realize that you ll have to shell out more dough for that controller once it eventually becomes available continue to next page 1 2 editors top picks 1 sony playstation 3 super slim

up top video review just add touch wrap-up comments down close if sbn.openx.istablet else when i reviewed the x1 carbon lenovo s flagship thinkpad laptop i found few faults it s an eye-catching computer that combines everything good about thinkpads great keyboard sturdy design solid performance with a fit and finish i didn t expect from the company s black box line of laptops its price was a little high and its bloatware portion was heaping but it was and still is one of my favorite windows 7 ultrabooks now that windows 8 is here in all its touch-friendly colorful glory lenovo s released a new x1 carbon with a touchscreen the x1 carbon touch is otherwise virtually identical to its untouchable sibling same processor same operating system same beautiful matte black carbon fiber body though a half-pound heavier it comes at a 150 premium sort of the cheapest carbon model is 1 249 and the cheapest touch is 1 499 but the touch s specs match the 1 349 model i spent some time with the carbon touch trying to decide if it s worth the extra weight and the extra price plus whether or not touchscreens are the future of laptops video review video review note this video is from our original review of the thinkpad x1 carbon imagine i touch the screen at some point in the video and something happens and you ll pretty much get the idea here just add touch just add touch lenovo thinkpad x1 carbon touch pictures previous next view full gallery previous next jdocument.readyfunction j gallery3650513 .gallery for once i m grateful windows laptops have stickers all over them because otherwise there s absolutely no way to tell the x1 carbon touch from the x1 carbon be sure and read our x1 carbon review for the full rundown but here s the quick version it s one of the best-looking laptops i ve ever seen the wedge-shaped carbon fiber body is sleek sturdy and almost soft to the touch the whole design is impressively minimal there are lenovo and thinkpad logos on the top and a couple of removable stickers plus another thinkpad logo in the palmrest just in case you forgot this is a thinkpad while you were opening it up but that s it the touch adds an easily-removable energy star sticker and removes the two indicator lights from the lid but i can t say i ever noticed the lights anyway the trackpoint and its buttons add the requisite red accents to the inside of the machine but the overwhelmingly black device still seems like something you d see jason bourne open up in his getaway car the carbon touch is slightly heavier than its non-touch counterpart 3.4 pounds vs three pounds flat without the touchscreen and about a credit card thicker i say about a credit card because it s more than the two pieces of paper i tried but less than the smart cover on my ipad mini i noticed only the difference in weight the x1 carbon feels remarkably light where the touch feels more like a normal ultrabook but it s still plenty svelte and won t weigh down your backpack or cause you scoliosis true to thinkpad form the carbon touch has a fantastic keyboard i ve always liked the smile design of the backlit keys which curves the bottom of each to leave more room between rows i can t say for sure but i swear i make fewer errors on the carbon than even on the macbook air i use every day i still can t stand that the fn and control keys are switched control is such an important key on a windows machine and i still haven t trained my finger to not look for the outermost key there also aren t quite as many function keys as i d like you can change brightness and control playback using the f1-f12 keys but not much more and they re not even the primary use for the keys so you have to hit fn and f12 every time you want to go to the next song lenovo nailed the design last time and didn t mess with it here the trackpad is also solid even better than it was on the original x1 carbon the software here is clearly improving it s smooth and glassy responsive and easy to use it doesn t do edge gestures particularly well yet but everything else works perfectly my only wish is that it were bigger using the yoga 11s s five-button trackpad instead of the separate trackpoint buttons the trackpoint by the way is the same as ever absolutely indispensable for some but mostly superfluous for trackpad devotees like me technically the screen is the same on both models as well a 1600 x 900 matte display that s not as vibrant as most glossy displays but is far more usable outdoors or in a bright room the muted colors are more noticeable thanks to windows 8 which is such a colorful operating system in general but i ll still take visibility over pop any day viewing angles are great from side to side but tilt the display too far forward or back and the colors start to go haywire like x1 carbon like x1 carbon touch except now when you touch its screen something actually happens lenovo s added a ten-finger multitouch panel to the carbon touch which makes the whole machine feel more at home running windows 8 as i ve grown more accustomed to the new os i ve found myself constantly reaching out and touching the screen to do things like connect to a wi-fi network or switch between apps it s not that you can t do these things with a mouse and keyboard but they re far faster using the touchscreen this touchscreen works really well too it s responsive to gestures and taps and it handled my epic eight-fingered fruit ninja battles with ease sleeker and faster for windows 8 unfortunately physics do get in the way a bit adding a touchscreen to the carbon means adding another physical layer between the display and your eye which has two effects one it makes everything feel a little further away so you feel like you re touching glass rather than whatever s underneath it on the display two the layer adds a slight sheen to the display a just-noticeable glittery effect that makes everything look a little bit more pixelated but all that said i unequivocally recommend getting a touchscreen on this or any windows 8 laptop not only is it a faster way to navigate in some instances it just feels more natural mousing around the big touch-friendly start screen is cumbersome and involves a crazy amount of scrolling or you can just swipe and tap some things like fruit ninja really aren t much fun without touch and what good is a computer without a good fruit ninja experience really even if you re not planning on using the touchscreen there s no real harm in getting it other than the extra cost neither performance nor battery life takes a hit on the x1 carbon touch windows 8 is a fast operating system in general and the carbon touch easily keeps up i tested it with a 1.80ghz core i5-3427u processor 4gb of ram and a 180gb ssd and had zero problems as i browsed the web streamed music from rdio and a couple of movies like drive which i finally got around to watching on netflix and generally worked a normal day no it s not a gaming machine it did okay with borderlands 2 on the lowest possible settings but fell apart as soon as i cranked it up at all but you shouldn t be using this for games anyway the x1 carbon touch is pure business you also shouldn t use the x1 carbon touch on your lap unless you have some leg hair you re not fond of like the x1 carbon this machine gets really really hot it s both silent and cool while handling normal tasks but the fan never really kicks into full gear when you re playing a game or streaming six videos at once a scenario i like to test and as a result the temperature goes through the roof i like how quiet the carbon is but i don t like having sweaty palms just from touching the machine there s still plenty of bloatware on the carbon touch but it s at least better hidden than on the non-touch model lenovo bundles a fistful of business-friendly apps into their own section on the start screen like lenovo companion and lenovo support plus evernote skitch skype and a few others upon your first venture to the desktop you ll be greeted with the friendly nags to upgrade the norton security suite you probably didn t want in the first place and a link to the lenovo solution center the total package isn t as cluttered here as on the original carbon windows 8 seems to have forced manufacturers to ease back a little and nothing is as constantly interruptive as the carbon s software was but crapware still abounds on the carbon touch there s no better way to tell windows 8 is built for speed than to test the carbon s boot times the windows 7-powered x1 carbon took 27 seconds to boot and without changing anything but the operating system lenovo got the carbon touch to start in a grand total of eight seconds resume time is basically zero in both cases but i was blown away by how quickly the carbon touch got up and running as i mentioned battery life hasn t really changed since the last carbon model that s good and bad good because touchscreen devices can often have shorter battery life bad because at between 4.5 and 5 hours on a typical charge battery life wasn t all that good to begin with luckily lenovo s impressive rapidcharge technology gives you about 50 percent battery in only about 30 minutes you ll need your charger with you all the time but at least you won t have to be plugged in for long wrap-up compare it lenovo thinkpad x1 carbon touch 7.6 verge score write review good stuff touchscreen works well gorgeous sleek design solid performance great keyboard bad stuff gets really hot expensive too much bloatware if you want a carbon buy the touchscreen but you might not want a carbon at all lenovo got a lot of things right with the thinkpad x1 carbon and all the advantages carry over to the carbon touch it s light gorgeous functional and powerful enough for every realistic ultrabook task but like the x1 carbon the carbon touch gets too hot comes with too much bloatware and just costs too much you could spend your 1 500 on an asus zenbook prime and get a better display or spend it on the macbook air if lenovo could either improve the battery life or sell the carbon touch for about 200 less buying it would be a no-brainer but as it is you re paying a huge premium for the fit and finish of the x1 carbon touch and unless your pockets are deep that might be hard to justify i really like the device but when i have to send back my review unit i don t think i ll be buying one i ll say this though if you re going to buy the x1 carbon buy the touchscreen as windows 8 matures it s going to become even more touch-friendly and i don t care what steve jobs said touchscreen laptops are awesome the fingerprints all over my macbook air s screen left as i prodded the display in vain can attest to that the breakdown more times than not the verge score is based on the average of the subscores below however since this is a non-weighted average we reserve the right to

display 8 performance 8 heat / noise 4 battery life 5 software 7 '),(412,'2013-03-10 00:00:00',8.1,84,' conclusion we like it the carbon touch takes everything that was good about the thinkpad x1 carbon -- including its fingerprint reader durable shell and excellent keyboard -- and adds a windows 8-friendly touchscreen making it a very good option for business travelers and the companies that sign off on their expense reports digital trends says the touch retains almost everything that is good about the original while adding the touchscreen many people value in a windows 8 machine and calls it one of the better windows 8 touchscreen laptops we ve tested laptop mag also likes the touch saying it s a strong and sleek ultrabook that combines windows 8 with a sharp touch screen however as with other windows 8 laptops battery life suffers and laptop points out that the touch lasts nearly 2 hours less on a charge than its non-touch windows 7 cousin that could disappoint some users though laptop says that anyone looking for a touchscreen windows 8 ultrabook will like what this notebook has to offer '),(413,'2013-01-16 00:00:00',8.0,84,' slide 2 slide 3 slide 4 slide 5 slide 6

of lenovo s x1 carbon itself a 14-inch update to the previous 13-inch thinkpad x1 it was a premium product very lightweight for a 14-inch laptop with a carbon fiber body and lenovo s typically excellent keyboard design but coming just a couple of months before windows 8 it quickly felt dated thanks to a flood of thin powerful windows 8 systems with touch screens -- a setup that has already become the default for nearly every new laptop fortunately lenovo has now updated the x1 carbon to microsoft s new os and also added a touch screen -- something that windows 8 practically requires for efficient navigation the new screen adds a bit of thickness to the lid but the system is otherwise very similar to the version reviewed last year and much of this review is likewise similar to that first x1 carbon the internal components are standard with a third-gen intel core i5 cpu integrated intel hd 4000 graphics and a 128gb solid-state drive ssd that s a common enough loadout and available in some very affordable laptops but no one would describe the x1 carbon as affordable the new touch version starts at 1 499 which is 100 more than the nontouch version of course you get a lot of extra features that may help justify the higher price including a suite of lenovo-branded security and support apps it-department-friendly features like intel s vpro technology and one of the best laptop keyboards ever designed it s still expensive especially compared with much of the ultrabook competition and has a handful of quirks but if you need those business-friendly features or just superior construction and a great typing experience it s worth the investment table.geekbox th table.geekbox tr.even .ratinggood .ratingaverage .ratingbad price as reviewed 1 499 processor intel core i5-3427u

inches system weight / weight with ac adapter 3.3/4.2 pounds category midsize design and features the new touch-screen x1 carbon is nearly identical to the original version but the addition of the touch screen means a slightly thicker lid it s not a big difference but we ve seen some very thin touch-screen lids on systems such as the acer aspire s7 and the x1 carbon frankly feels chunky compared with some of the higher-end new windows 8 touch-screen laptops but this is still a premium-feeling system the top cover is made of carbon fiber typically found in only the most expensive laptops as is the system s internal roll cage a stiff latticework that protects the laptop but adds minimal extra weight the backlit keyboard retains the modified island-style keys used in several recent thinkpads a look that comes from lenovo s consumer line and that is slowly making its way into other thinkpad models as well as with other island-style lenovo keyboards the individual keys have a slightly convex curve at the bottom i ve found that bit of extra surface area makes typing easier and mistakes less frequent lenovo refers to the shape created by the keys and the space between them as the forgiveness zone many thin laptops have shallow clacky keys that are better than typing on something like the ipad s virtual keyboard but often not by much even on this slim chassis the keys have excellent depth and solid tactile feedback it s definitely the best ultrathin laptop keyboard i ve used the touch pad is a bit of a departure from the usual lenovo style instead of a touch pad with separate left and right mouse buttons below it s a one-piece click pad with a glass surface similar to what you d get on a macbook or dell xps there is still a second set of mouse buttons above it and a traditional lenovo thinkpad track point nestled between the g h and b keys the slick glass surface is a welcome change from the normal sluggish feel of so many windows touch pads for multitouch gestures it was great but i had less luck with basic tap-to-click navigation and the pad was finicky and unresponsive at times or called up windows 8 navigation features inadvertently tweaking the touch-pad settings helped a bit but there were plenty of times i tapped with no response and i was not happy with the out-of-the-box performance of the touch pad the display is excellent with a matte finish on the 14-inch 1 600x900-pixel-resolution screen i ve seen more high-end laptops lately add a full hd 1 920x1 080-pixel screen on a 15-inch system it works but on a 13-inch it s too much making text and icons too small on a 14-inch you could go either way but i d lean toward 1 600x900 pixels as seen here as the sweet spot the screen is bright and colorful despite the lack of a glossy coating you may never use this feature but it s interesting to note that the screen folds nearly 180 degrees back lying almost flat there have not been many times i ve wished my laptop would open wider but i suppose there have been a handful lenovo s yoga line takes this to the next level with screens that fold back nearly 360 degrees to become tablets people usually don t buy thinkpads for their great speakers -- but they do buy them for the microphone and webcam as used in videoconferencing using the handy built-in videoconferencing app you can set the mic s pickup pattern turn on

rather obviously named thinkpad x1 carbon touch lenovo brings its flagship ultrabook into the windows 8 era adding a touchscreen to the package but leaving most of the rest of the device unchanged if you were enthralled by the carbon during its first go-round late last year and are prepared to add touchability to your routine it s definitely a laptop to consider the two devices are so similar you d be hard-pressed to tell them apart without a set of calipers fortunately i have a set of calipers and some other tools and can confirm that the touch is a shade thicker 2mm a hair heavier 3.1 versus 3.0 pounds and about 15 percent dimmer than its forebear all signs of the price to be paid for adding a touchscreen to a laptop that said according to lenovo it is still the world s lightest 14-inch notebook with touch photo by ariel zambelich/wired ports are identical to the last version of the device two usb ports one 3.0 one 2.0 and chargeable mini-displayport with no hdmi or vga and an sd card reader lcd resolution is 1600 x 900 pixels also unchanged configurations vary but this review unit was equipped with a 1.8ghz core i5 4gb of ram and a 180gb ssd hard drive compared to the older-generation core i7-based carbon i reviewed in august 2012 performance is on par overall benchmark scores were exemplary while the integrated gpu held the machine back in the video department this is of course a corporate-class laptop so no one s expecting to play high-framerate skyrim on it anyway the expected thinkpad amenities are standard including vpro management tpm a fingerprint reader and even an optional integrated wwan 3g radio the carbon fiber cover and cage are in lenovo s parlance satellite quality and the chassis certainly feels more durable than sputnik lenovo also hasn t forgotten about the things that users actually care about audio is impressive and dolby-certified the keyboard is backlit and fully usable and the glass touchpad was rock solid on this go-round with the carbon the 2012 unit i tested had a disturbingly loose one photo by ariel zambelich/wired only two complaints marred my experience with the x1 touch foremost is battery life while i managed to score an extra half hour of video playback versus the old x1 at 3.5 hours of running time it is still at the bottom of the heap of windows 8 laptops when it comes to longevity the screen is also relatively dim and colors look a bit washed out in comparison to other recent-model laptops of course there s also the not-insubstantial price to consider too the x1 touch starts at 1 350 and as configured runs a hefty 1 729 that s cheaper than the non-touch carbon i reviewed in the fall but still a huge investment in a laptop and hundreds of dollars more expensive than the competition in

stars comparing the roughly half-dozen intel atom windows 8 tablets that we ve seen to date is relatively easy nearly all of them from the hp envy x2 to the dell latitude 10 are built around essentially identical hardware platforms starting with an intel atom cpu 2gb of ram and a 64gb ssd along with either a 10- or 11-inch 1 366x768-pixel screen the real differentiators are price available accessories and the design and construction of the tablet plastic versus metal for example for lenovo in particular this is a tale of two tablets the 10-inch thinkpad tablet 2 and the 11-inch ideatab lynx also known as the ideatab k3011 on paper at least these two products are remarkably similar both stick to the guidelines outlined above and have a 1.8ghz intel 2760 processor 2gb of ram 64gb of solid-state storage and both cost about the same with the thinkpad tablet 2 starting at 679 and the lynx at 649 but there are differences beyond the 30 price break and they don t always favor the allegedly more consumer-friendly lynx the thinkpad version has a full usb 2.0 built in offers wireless broadband and nfc options and has dual webcams the ideatab version has a bigger screen 11 inches versus 10 inches and its keyboard dock includes a second battery for longer overall battery life credit sarah tew/cnet like the hp envy x2 or acer w510 the lynx feels more like an ultraportable laptop when plugged into its clamshell-like keyboard base but it doesn t stack up to even inexpensive ultrabooks in terms of hands-on utility and usability annoyingly lenovo s web site doesn t seem to have the 129 keyboard dock for sale as of this writing but i ve seen it from amazon staples and others for as much as 20 above the list price as a standalone tablet the lynx benefits from its bigger screen but also feels less substantial with a plastic back instead of the metal back panel of the thinkpad tablet 2 side by side unless you really need an 11-inch screen over a 10-inch

with lower prices than core i5 tablets most of the atom-powered windows 8 tablets we ve seen tend toward plastic construction and generally looser designs there are rare exceptions as in the case of this tablet s sister product the thinkpad tablet 2 as a standalone tablet the lynx has a footprint on the larger end of the spectrum it s thin and light but the plastic back panel does not inspire confidence nor do other plastic-backed tablets to be fair it s when connected to its optional 129 keyboard/battery dock that the lynx really finds its own personality the two pieces together look and feel more like a clamshell laptop than a tablet with a keyboard accessory -- it s a style also found in the hp envy x2 and acer w510 the balance between the screen and base is better in the lynx than those other two examples and less prone to tipping over the connection is made via a bulky central hinge and the release mechanism is a big physical button in the middle similar to those found on similar systems from hp samsung and others it s an inelegant look especially compared with the way more tablet-oriented hybrids such as the surface pro or thinkpad tablet 2 connect with their keyboards but i don t think anyone has really nailed the perfect clamshell hybrid hinge design yet credit sarah tew/cnet the keyboard dock adds some additional ports but more importantly contains an extra battery for extended use the keyboard is of the usual lenovo design with flat-topped keys that bow out slightly at the bottom the keyboard layout is great for typing on a small system but the entire keyboard dock has a lot of flex especially towards the middle it s frankly unusual for a lenovo and a bit cheap-feeling adding to my frustration the latch connecting the screen and keyboard felt sticky even with the release button firmly pressed the two parts didn t come apart cleanly and required some awkward tugging almost every time the touch pad below the keyboard omits both left and right mouse buttons and a trackpoint in favor of clickpad-style buttons which gives you the maximum finger surface on the small pad the big 11.6-inch display is a highlight the 1 366x768-pixel resolution is standard for an atom-powered windows 8 tablet but the screen is clear and bright with excellent off-axis viewing angles and a very responsive touch surface table.geekbox th table.geekbox

surprisingly sturdy thanks to a magnesium alloy internal frame inside the chassis which acts like a roll cage to protect the components within the polycarbonate chassis is nowhere near as luxurious or sturdy as the all-metal hp envy x2 but it at least feels sturdy unlike the asus vivotab smart which felt lightweight and cheaply made view all 5 photos in gallery the 11.6-inch in-plane switching ips display looks good even when cradled close in a lap or the crook of an arm with 1366-by-768 resolution with five-point capacitive touch you ll be able to use the tablet with multiple fingers using one or two hands and the ips display offers wide viewing angles so there s no worry about having to hold the tablet at a specific angle like most of the tablets we ve seen the sound on the ideatab lynx is wimpy at best it s really more of a headphone-friendly device anyway the sound is quite weak even at high volume and when we tested the speakers with the knife s bass-heavy silent shout it sounded like an entirely different song because there was almost no bass at all when using earbuds or a headset however the sound was just fine features on the edges of the tablet you ll find two ports to speak of a micro hdmi port on the side and a micro usb 2.0 port on the bottom the micro usb port looks a little different as it doubles as a docking port for the accessory keyboard but it will still work with any micro usb cable for those instances when you need to connect a usb drive using a full-size port there is a micro-to-full size usb adapter included with the tablet there s no micro hdi adapter so you ll need to acquire one yourself before you can hook it up to your hdtv it s irksome but we have yet to see a manufacturer bundle in a micro hdmi adapter additionally there is a microsd card slot but it s recessed and set behind a port cover putting it out of convenient reach and making it difficult to remove the memory card once it s in the slot the ideatab lynx is also equipped with a front-facing 2-megapixel webcam and two digital microphones for use with skype and the like but despite the tablet design there is no rear-facing camera so you won t be using the lynx to shoot snapshots at tourist attractions despite this there are several sensors more common to smartphones and android tablets that windows machines like an accelerometer ambient light sensing to adjust screen brightness automatically and proximity sensing and an e-compass the more familiar 802.11n wi-fi and bluetooth 4.0 provide the wireless connectivity you ll need to get online and pair wireless mice and keyboards without the need for a usb adapter the tablet is equipped with a 64gb solid-state drive ssd though some of that is occupied by the operating system and included software in addition to windows 8 32-bit the ideatab lynx comes with an array of apps and programs already installed lenovo makes sure to include genuinely useful services and apps like lenovo cloud by sugarsync which makes it easier to automatically share files between the lynx and your laptop or desktop microsoft office starter gives you limited word and powerpoint with the option to upgrade and a 30-day trial of norton internet security and norton studio on the start screen you ll find several apps including skype evernote amazon s kindle reader encyclopedia britannica and merriam webster dictionary finally lenovo covers the ideatab lynx with a one-year warranty though you can purchase extended protection that stretches it to two or three performance like most 10- and 11-inch windows tablets on the market today the ideatab lynx is equipped with a dual-core 1.8ghz intel atom z2760 processor with 2gb of ram the use of an atom processor means you ll be running windows in 32-bit mode instead of the 64-bit found in standard laptops and desktops but you ll still be able to run most programs albeit with slower performance than you may be used to in pcmark 7 the lynx produced a category leading score of 1 438 points tied with the asus vivotab smart and beating other top-rated competitors like the dell latitude 10 1 291 points and the hp envy x2 1 429 points the lynx s cinebench scores are actually the best of the category 0.56 despite the fact that the same processor is found in competitors like the dell xps 13 0.46 and the acer iconia tab w510-1422 0.30 it also performed well in handbrake finishing in 6 minutes 26 seconds and coming within one second of the category-leading hp envy x2 6 25 the energy-efficient atom processor does lend itself well to tablets which require greater freedom from power cords in our battery rundown test the lynx lasted 7 hours 33 minutes while it s enough to take you through the day it actually trails behind other tablets like the acer iconia tab w510-1422 8 59 the dell latitude 10 9 20 and even lenovo s own thinkpad tablet 2 10 11 while the battery life is a bit short it s still long-lasting and the strong overall performance makes it a solid contender among atom-powered windows tablets as windows machines go it s far from full-featured but if you want something for content consumption and casual windows computing the lenovo

amazon.com 989.99 see it set price alert the biggest hardware trend marking the launch of windows 8 is the proliferation of touch-screen laptop/tablet hybrids some have screens that pull apart to become separate tablets while others have screens that flip twist or rotate to give you a tabletlike shape to hold we call those latter models convertible laptops and one of the best examples to date is the new lenovo ideapad yoga 13 the name yoga is suggestive of the system s big selling point that the display flips fully over to become a tablet in fact it has four basic usable positions -- clamshell laptop tablet stand and tent the reason the yoga stands out from the suddenly crowded touch-screen laptop scene is that it does something other convertible or hybrid laptops do not when set up as a traditional laptop the 13.3-inch yoga doesn t compromise the all-important clamshell experience the excellent double-hinge design means that it looks and works the same as any other ultrabook laptop unlike the complex and often clunky mechanisms in systems such as the hp envy x2 sony vaio duo 11 or dell xps 12 the yoga works best as a full-time laptop and part-time tablet because when it s folded back into a slate you still have the keyboard pointing out from the back of the system although the keyboard and touch pad are deactivated in this mode it s still not ideal plus despite the hype windows 8 is still not a 100-percent tablet-friendly os and there are some frustrations that span all the windows 8 tablet-style devices we ve tested the yoga certainly seems to be everyone s choice for a great windows 8 ambassador -- both microsoft and intel have touted it as a best-in-class example and best buy is currently featuring it in a television ad at 1 099 you re paying a bit of a premium but not outrageously so for an intel core i5/8gb ram/128gb solid-state drive ssd configuration note that our early review unit had only 4gb of ram installed but a less expensive core i3

4000 operating system windows 8 dimensions wd 13.1x8.9 inches height 0.67 inch screen size diagonal 13.3 inches category 13-inch design features and display despite its reputation as a maker of buttoned-down business laptops lenovo can always be counted on to produce intriguing designs most of those end up like the yoga as part of the company s consumer-targeted ideapad line of products we ve seen similar attempts at laptops that can double as tablets over the years usually with a rotating center hinge that swivels around to let the device change forms or more recently with a screen that slides down over the keyboard before windows 8 most of these experiments weren t particularly successful thanks to a combination of poor design underpowered components and an operating system that wasn t touch-friendly the other problem with those traditional convertibles has been that the single rotating center hinge was a potential weak point in the design lenovo says the yoga s full-length hinge has been rigorously tested and is stronger than the older rotating convertible design and in practice that definitely seems to be the case when opened into its clamshell position the yoga would be tough to pick out of a lineup of recent ultrabooks the minimalist interior is dominated by a large buttonless clickpad along with a island-style lenovo keyboard which means the flat-topped keys have a small curve along their bottom edges for easier typing as good as lenovo s reputation is for excellent keyboards i had a surprising amount of trouble with the yoga s keyboard i narrowed most of my issues down to the half-size right shift key which meant i often hit the up arrow when aiming for shift the end result was a lot of frustration and retyping but after a few days one would naturally adjust to this specific layout the touch pad is the same as you d find in other clickpad lenovos including the recent high-end x1 carbon it offers plenty of space for multifinger gestures but isn t as effective for manipulating the touch-centric windows 8 ui as a finger would be when you flip the yoga s screen back the physical keyboard doesn t disappear from view as it does on most other convertible laptop/tablet combos but it does get automatically disabled a slightly raised layer of leather over the wrist rest and keyboard tray lets you rest the tablet on a table keyboard-side down without worrying too much about damaging the keys some buttons have been moved to the sides so they can be accessed no matter how the system is folded and the outer shell has a soft-touch coating for easy gripping while the yoga isn t particularly comfortable to hold in tablet form as your fingers are pressing up against the exposed keyboard and the touch pad you do get easy access to a volume rocker along one edge and a rotation lock button along the other beyond the slate mode i especially liked the stand or sharing mode where the screen is folded back 270 degrees or more turning the system into something like a small touch-screen kiosk it s great for sharing video or presentations in a group setting or for just getting closer to the screen while keeping the keyboard out of the way its fourth position is standing upright like a tent but i can t think of too many reasons you d want that in any of these positions the yoga is well-served by its 13.3-inch display which has a native resolution of 1 600x900 pixels that s arguably the perfect resolution for a 13-inch laptop giving you plenty of screen real estate without making onscreen text appear too small as can happen with 1 920x1 080-pixel resolutions on smaller systems off-axis viewing angles are great and unlike with some windows 8 convertibles stuck with 1 366x768-pixel screen resolutions

this first run of windows 8 devices manufacturers are essentially throwing things against the wall to see what sticks we ve seen every size every form factor every direction and angle of rotation companies are trying desperately to figure out the best way to take advantage of everything windows 8 can do even lenovo s lineup is all over the place there s the lynx convertible which transforms from laptop to tablet the twist rotates and folds and looks like the x series tablets we ve seen for years and then there s the ideapad yoga perhaps the most enticing of the bunch we ve been waiting for this device to come out ever since it was announced at ces back in january the yoga s crazy gimmick is its hinge which allows the screen to fold all the way back over the keyboard so you can hold your laptop like a tablet carnival sideshow tricks aside though the ideapad is still a pretty appealing windows 8 laptop my review unit has a 1.7ghz core i5 processor 4gb of ram and a 128gb ssd in an attractive 3.5-pound package it s more laptop than tablet but it s trying to be both and much more is this the windows 8 ultrabook for you and for me video review video review hardware hardware and design more than meets the eye lenovo ideapad yoga 13 hands-on pictures previous next view full gallery previous next jdocument.readyfunction j gallery3386887 .gallery the yoga s a fairly innocuous ultrabook the matte gray machine s black sides slightly rounded and sloped corners and undecorated exterior definitely won t catch your eye on a store shelf but that s not necessarily a bad thing it s nice-looking in a simple sort of way at three and a half pounds and two-thirds of an inch thick it s just a middle-of-the-road ultrabook it s noticeably heavier and larger than a macbook air or the thinkpad x1 carbon but not so large to worsen my back problems as i carried it around the clamshell s gray exterior opens up to reveal entirely black insides the keys palmrest bezel and trackpad are all the same matte black the understated look matches well with the ultra-colorful windows 8 interface taking no attention away from the display the only problem is that the display s hard to get at the yoga s base isn t heavy enough to hold in place so you need both hands to open the lid and it s hard to get enough purchase underneath the tiny lip on the front to get the top open on the right side of the yoga if you re using it like a laptop as you ll see sides are all very fungible with this device sit a full-size sd card slot a usb 2.0 port and the blocky yellow jack for the power adapter the one and only usb 3.0 port rests on the left next to an hdmi port and the headphone jack the power button is on the front and there are physical volume controls on the left side both are very unlike a laptop s normal configuration but make sense for all the ways you ll use the yoga and much though i worried about it i never once accidentally pressed the power button in my lap its leathery palmrest and soft-touch exterior give the yoga a very comfortable feel unlike the cold slickness of say the macbook air the matte exterior is a bit odd to the touch though one of my co-workers said it kind of feels like touching a human i definitely prefer the look of the thinkpad x1 carbon which combines the comfortable feel with a more handsome design the yoga is well-made for sure but it won t exactly get the oohs and ahhs the x1 carbon did its contortionist ways are great without causing any problems if you never felt the desire to test the integrity of the yoga s hinge you might never know the device s most impressive trick and thus always wonder why in the world this thing is called the yoga but if you open the clamshell and push the screen back and back and back you ll figure it out the screen can rotate a full 360 degrees minus however many separate one side of the base from the other creating a bunch of different ways to use this device you can rotate it all the way around flip the thing around and hold it like a tablet with the screen facing you and the keys underneath your fingers on the back some people might not like that your fingers touch the keyboard as you hold it in tablet mode but i didn t mind it and it actually makes the yoga a little easier to grip you can prop the yoga up like a teepee i did so constantly since it s an ideal way to watch movies you can also use the keyboard tray as a stand for the display as if the screen were mounted to the front of the base rather than the back the hinge is sturdy enough to hold in almost any position so anything you can think of you can probably pull off on one hand it s all a bit of a gimmick flipping it around so it s closed with the screen facing out does make the yoga much more like a tablet a huge giant unwieldy tablet but in every other setup it s still a screen and a stand but there s something different when you can t see the keyboard the screen doesn t feel so far away and i found myself somehow more immersed than i normally am watching things on my laptop this is the way i hope windows 8 laptops go instead of trying to find some happy medium between laptop and tablet i hope manufacturers build devices that just add new use cases or form factors to the equation a keyboard and mouse for a tablet or an ersatz tablet mode for a laptop microsoft s own surface falls into the no-man s-land between the two form factors and suffers as a result meanwhile the yoga is every ounce a laptop it just does a cool extra thing most laptops don t i like the flipping hinge more than the swiveling actions of the thinkpad twist but either way i think the approach is right don t build one device to replace two just pick one nail the core experience and crib a couple of features from the other display speakers display and speakers all its contortionist tendencies aside the yoga s screen is relatively uninteresting it s a good display to be sure the 13.3-inch ips panel s 1600 x 900 resolution is a notch above many ultrabooks and its color reproduction and brightness are both as good as i d expect but it pales next to the 1080p screens on the asus zenbook prime and a few others especially when you use it as a tablet 1600 x 900 is more than adequate at a typical laptop distance and 1080p might even be too high in some cases making everything on the screen seem tiny but when you hold the screen closer to your face every pixel really counts but still it s neither the best nor the worst display i ve seen on a device in this class this size or this price the only problem i had with the screen was its touch response the yoga seemed to miss a few more taps and swipes than i d normally expect it also occasionally registered taps when i meant to swipe and swipes when i meant to tap it didn t happen often or reliably i couldn t recreate problems for instance but i wound up swiping right and opening the new york times app a few too many times two speakers are hidden in the fan vents on the rear of the machine and they re more or less bog standard decent enough and these actually have richer-than-average sound but nothing special i periodically get stockholm syndrome with computer speakers thinking they re totally adequate and then i plug my computer into my external speakers and my ears immediately rejoice and look upon my computer with disdain that happened about thirty times with the yoga nice to look at but not to touch keyboard trackpad keyboard and trackpad since this is an ideapad and not a thinkpad there are a couple of key accoutrements missing there s no red trackpoint nipple and no separate clickable mouse buttons personally i don t miss either but if you re a trackpoint devotee that might be a dealbreaker instead you get a sleek all-black tray with a clickpad and six rows of full-size keys lenovo s good at this gameboth are more like a thinkpad than not and that s a great thing the keyboard uses the same smile design we saw on the x1 carbon and elsewhere the slightly concave keys are comfortable to use easy to get used to and have just the right amount of travel and feedback the only problem is the layout the right-side shift and backspace keys are half their normal size and i found myself accidentally hitting and / a lot the home end pgup / dn keys take up the right-most column on the keyboard and it throws off the alignment of the keyboard otherwise i always had to set my hands where i thought home row was and then move them one key to the left before i could type properly but after a few hours of using the yoga exclusively i was fully up to speed typing as fast and accurately as i can on any other machine as long as it was light out anyway the keyboard isn t backlit which is a really frustrating omission trackpad the trackpad s a mixed bag its surface is smooth and glassy and my fingers glide over it easily but what happens on the screen isn t quite on the same level two-finger scrolling works but sometimes takes a couple of swipes to kick in it s like it needs to warm up before it s ready to scroll it does scroll both vertically and horizontally though which is great for moving around the start screen and windows 8 apps as a pure pointing device it never failed me but it misses on some of the more complex things edge gestures key to navigating windows 8 are maddeningly inconsistent sometimes i was just moving my finger left and it swiped in the most recent app and then when i d try to switch apps it would just move the cursor a bit it s like it was teasing me these are certainly driver issues and probably can and will be fixed but i was frequently reminded how many bugs are left to work out in windows 8 software performance software and performance i m on the hunt for a new primary machine so beyond our benchmark tests i ve been subjecting every windows 8 review unit to some rigorous testing to see how it holds up on a normal day that includes three different browsers running something like 25 tabs at a time lots of multitasking and app use and the occasional photoshop job the yoga handles all of those things fine though when i tried to do as many things as possible at once all those tabs a netflix movie the hulu windows 8 app and photoshop it stumbled pretty hard but that s not exactly a practical use case and as an everyday machine for everyday uses it works just fine the machine resumes from sleep in about three seconds and boots in only seven i m still blown away by how fast windows 8 starts up the yoga s even a vaguely usable gaming machine which is leaps and bounds better than i can say for most ultrabooks older games like tom clancy s h.a.w.x play relatively smoothly and even newer games like call of duty modern warfare 3 which cripples most ultrabooks was at least decently playable at native resolution and low settings though by no means should you mistake this for a competitor to an actual gaming rig mcafee s been crippled but it s not dead yet there were some odd performance issues though which like the trackpad serve as all-too-frequent reminders that microsoft has a lot of tweaking left to do with windows 8 the yoga sometimes wouldn t reconnect to a wi-fi network when it resumed from sleep even though it saw a known network otherwise-stable apps also crashed a few more times than i expected these aren t deal-breakers just minor annoyances but they re always lurking in the background as you use the yoga if the yoga s bloatware is indicative of what s to come on windows 8 devices the world s about to become a much better place yes the company adds plenty of its own software kindle ebay evernote skype accuweather.com and a handful of first-party utilities come preinstalled but that s it yes mcafee is installed on the yoga but not as a nagging pop-up telling you your computer is irreparably damaged and only mcafee can fix it it s just an app if manufacturers have decided to take a lesson from phones and only add new apps to the equation the windows experience is about to get a lot better battery heat noise battery heat noise continuing the theme of a pretty normal machine that does wacky things with its hinge the yoga s battery life is about what you d expect from an ultrabook it lasted five hours eight minutes on the verge battery test which cycles through a series of popular websites and high-res images with the screen set to 65 percent brightness in normal use charge it fully unplug it work a regular day and see how long it lasts i got between five and five and a half hours depending on how many times i needed to use photoshop that s an acceptable result but nothing to write home about the yoga s fans kick in basically any time you touch the computer it doesn t take much for them to start whirring most of the time it s really quiet though and you ll only notice it in a silent room plus the machine barely gets warm unless you re cranking through the witcher 2 and if some slight fan noise is the tradeoff i ll take it when you re gaming or using a heavy app like photoshop though the fan blasts hot air out the back at a pretty high volume no sleep til.. five hours from now wrap-up compare it lenovo ideapad yoga 13 7.7 verge score write review good stuff lots of form factors in one device good high-res display great keyboard bad stuff finicky touchscreen a few software and performance bugs touchpad is maddeningly inconsistent a big step in the right direction but i d wait for step two or three if you ignore its awesome transformational abilities which are a pretty great addition to a laptop and are implemented really well the ideapad yoga 13 is just an average pretty good laptop it has a good keyboard a nice-looking screen and competent performance it also has a frustrating trackpad though and a touchscreen that doesn t work as well as it should it s a perfectly good laptop and that s about what i expect for a 1 000 ultrabook if you re buying a windows 8 laptop right now this is a really good option it s definitely the best device i ve tested since the new os came out but if you can wait you should there are many more cool devices coming soon and even the yoga should get better over time as the trackpad drivers and performance issues are fixed what i want more than anything is the thinkpad x1 carbon with a yoga hinge this is a decent

sharp bright responsive touchscreen display and good keyboard in laptop mode it works very well and being able to use both a touchpad or external mouse and the touchscreen helps bridge the gap between windows 8-style apps and desktop apps in tablet mode it s a little bulky and cumbersome and the keyboard remains exposed though lenovo sells an optional cover to protect it because the display rotates 180 degrees on a sturdy hinge you can also use it with the display facing outward or in tent mode which is convenient for watching videos if you re ready to take the plunge and embrace windows 8 the yoga is a good choice and if you re not and just want to use it as a laptop in desktop mode it s also a good option '),(420,'2012-11-16 00:00:00',8.0,86,' pros solid windows 8 ultrabook folds back for

ideapad yoga 13 is a solid ultrabook but as a tablet it s a little too big for comfort otherwise the yoga 13 has the best hybrid design we ve seen so far by brian westover the lenovo ideapad yoga 13 is almost everything we want in a hybrid ultrabook as an ultrabook the yoga 13 offers an uncompromised computing experience while wedding windows 8 with the touch screen it deserves and delivering performance that will keep you satisfied at work and play as a dual function device it transitions elegantly and intuitively standing out from the rest with the best hinge mechanism we ve seen on a hybrid but as a tablet it falters it s too big and for a device that offers convenience and mobility that s a significant drawback that said the lenovo ideapad yoga 13 is an excellent ultrabook a

soft-touch paint .zd-video function c if window.jwplayer document.readyfunction k new array f .extendc jwplayerthis.id.setupf loading.. after using hybrids that utilize sliding hinges and rotating screens the stability and simplicity of lenovo s hinge design is a revelation manufacturers take note this is how you navigate the combination of laptop and tablet the hinge design also allows the yoga to bend and twist in other new ways allowing for not only laptop and tablet modes but also stand mode with the touch-screen standing up from the base and tent mode with the ultrabook propped hinge-up when folded behind the screen in tablet mode the keyboard and mouse automatically deactivate letting you touch and swipe unhindered these extra modes are especially handy when kicking back with a movie despite the excellence of the hinge design the yoga 13 does have one design flaw because it uses the same 16 9 aspect ratio that is common on windows pcs the 13-inch screen becomes awkwardly long when held in portrait mode were it an 11-inch system like the sony vaio duo 11 the size would be just right measuring 0.66 by 13.4 by 8.85 inches hwd the yoga 13 is well sized as an ultrabook but it s too big for comfortable tablet use it s also a bit heavy 3.4 pounds just a little heavier than the 3.3-pound dell xps 12 this is one time that i wish lenovo had opted for lighter plastics instead of aluminum because the elongated dimensions of the device draw attention to the weight making it more noticeable than on the dell xps 12 the keyboard utilizes the same accutype keys seen on the lenovo ideapad u310 with each keycap curved ever so slightly for a more comfortable typing feel than you ll get with the usual chiclet keyboard and a scalloped key shape instead of the usual square keys it s one of the best keyboards found on an ultrabook convertible or otherwise and it s matched by lenovo s intellipad multitouch mouse with a smooth glass surface and clickable surface it s responsive enough that you may just forget about the touch screen features ports connections include usb 3.0 and 2.0 a full-size card reader sd/sdhc mc and full-size hdmi output lenovo also offers its onekey recovery feature though it has changed the name of the onekey button to the awkward sounding novo button wireless offerings include 802.11n wi-fi and bluetooth 4.0 but also notable is what you won t find on the yoga 13 like widi offered on the dell xps 12 and nfc communication offered on the sony vaio duo 11 d11213cx while nfc may not be missed the lack of wi-di feels like a gap in the feature set the yoga 13 comes with a 128gb solid-state drive ssd the same capacity seen in the vaio duo 11 but half that of the dell xps 12 128gb lenovo s plain vanilla ultrabook the ideapad u310 offers considerably more storage space 500gb thanks to a spinning hard drive but spinning drives don t work well unless kept stationary which would limit the yoga 13 s mobility there s no optical drive but we didn t expect one on a device so thin fire up the yoga 13 and you ll find a few programs already featured on the windows 8 start screen like a 30-day trial of mcafee security advisor and mcafee antivirus plus along with a starter version of microsoft office 2010 though we wish it were office 2013 which was made with windows 8 in mind windows 8 apps like amazon s kindle app and the ebay app make an appearance as does sugarsync manager there are a few other programs you ll find if you look hard enough in desktop mode like nitro pro 7 a pdf reader and youcam for use with the webcam but nothing too intrusive lenovo covers the yoga 13 with a one-year warranty performance the yoga 13 resembles other ultrabooks in more than mere appearance it s outfitted with a 1.7ghz intel core i5-3317u dual-core processor and 4gb of ram a setup identical to the lenovo u310 and similar to the sony vaio duo 11 which offered 8gb of ram instead of 4 in our productivity benchmark tests pcmark 7 the yoga 13 scored 4 417 points performing neck in neck with both the dell xps 12 4 638 and the sony vaio duo 11 4 648 though the yoga 13 did return higher frame rates in high-resolution gaming tests this difference is due not to any superior hardware but the fact that the display resolution on the yoga 13 maxes out at 1600-by-900 instead of the 1 920-by-1 080 seen on the lower scoring dell xps 12 and sony vaio duo 11 regardless all of the gaming results while similar were well below the threshold needed for serious gaming you ll still be able to enjoy basic games like cut the rope and fruit ninja and perhaps some basic 3d gaming like team fortress 2 but you won t be playing skyrim in hd on the yoga 13 while gaming may be off the table portability is still a chief concern while we couldn t test the yoga 13 with our usual mobilemark benchmark test we did perform a simple video rundown test as we did on both the dell xps 12 and sony duo 11 the yoga 13 lasted five hours even while the dell xps 12 edged slightly ahead 5 09 and the sony duo 11 fell almost two hours behind 3 09 the lenovo ideapad yoga 13 is a very good ultrabook and with a price tag of 999 it offers a lot a reasonable feature set touch screen and good design if you just want a great ultrabook the yoga 13 is good but the editors choice toshiba portege z935-p300 is better with similar specs and performance but lighter thinner construction and a lower price as a hybrid ultrabook however the yoga 13 has a versatile touch screen a flexible design and the best laptop-to-tablet transition mechanics we ve yet seen in a hybrid it s good enough that we hope other manufacturers adopt similar designs but at a better size the yoga 13 is just a little too big for comfortable use as a tablet if you are shopping for a windows 8 ultrabook laptop with touch capability and plan on only using the tablet mode occasionally then the yoga 13 is a smart choice but the dell xps 12 is better

windows 8 tablets the market is going to embrace if any lenovo figured this out early and it s releasing windows 8 portables in no fewer than four different form factors the most promising of these is arguably the ideapad yoga at first blush this laptop looks like any old 13-inch ultrabook and its core specs follow suit 1.7ghz core i5 4gb ram 128gb ssd and a scant 18mm of thickness but bend the yoga s screen back and it goes completely flat now keep going the screen goes past 180 degrees to 270 then 360 until the back of the screen is resting against the underside of the laptop now flip it over and you ve got a slate tablet in your hands it s a neat trick and one you can have added fun with by breaking the laptop over your knee in a mock show of frustration while in the presence of your fellow gadget fiends the screen goes past 180 degrees to 270 then 360 until the back of the screen is resting against the underside of the laptop while the yoga offers no surprises on its benchmarks integrated graphics mean angry birds is about as fancy as you ll want to get it does feel surprisingly spry fast and agile in regular use the keyboard works well though a row of keys to the right of the normal end of the keyboard make some buttons like backspace difficult to find without a bit of a hunt and the touchpad is a knockout the 13.3-inch 1600 x 900 pixel touchscreen is reasonably bright and responsive though sharp-eyed readers will note that unlike most of the windows 8 tablets coming out the yoga does not quite have a 1920 x 1080 hd screen i m still on the fence about how serious a flaw this is on one hand it s a bummer not to have full 1080p resolution but on the other hand it s difficult enough to navigate the windows desktop as it is on a 1600 x 900 screen higher resolution would make those icons even smaller and tougher to tap accurately in the end most of the time the resolution difference didn t impact me at all what is more problematic is the sheer size of the yoga at 3.4 pounds the yoga 13 is well over twice the heft of an ipad and it feels truly gargantuan when in slate mode making you feel a bit like moses coming down from mount sinai when you wield it with the appropriate gravitas it is really pushing the limits of comfort and usability for a slate note that a 2.8-pound 11-inch yoga is also available photo by alex washburn/wired of course a design this new means there are some natural growing pains to deal with the biggest of these can be found in the hinge system the double-hinge design makes the 360-degree fold possible but when you use the yoga as a standard laptop the hinge just isn t tight enough if you like to touch the screen directly instead of using the touchpad periodically like most windows 8 users do the bounce and jitter that erupts from even light taps and swipes is enough to make you seasick connectivity options are sparse the two usb ports one 2.0 and one 3.0 feel a bit stingy hdmi and an sd card slot are your only other options that other rectangular port is for the a/c adapter so don t try wedging a thumb drive into it overall this is a thoughtful and very usable hybrid with an abundance of both little touches like a motion-control system that works via the webcam and big ones like the keyboard automatically disabling when the yoga s in slate mode while i m not sure that anyone really wants a tablet that s quite this big at the very least it s a solid contender for the laptop user who just wants the occasional touchscreen experience available wired lenovo motion control system lets you manage audio and video hands free stays fairly cool even under load solid battery life 4.5 hours versus the competition special sleeve covers the underside keyboard when in slate mode so you aren t feeling the buttons

a lot to prove since the day samsung showed the first one off at ces last year they ve consistently been priced higher than the equivalent macbook air and that can be a pretty hard sell if you want a premium windows machine though a macbook air just won t do so when i reviewed the 15-inch samsung series 9 i was hopeful that its 1 500 price tag meant it would be the windows ultrabook of choice going forward if you read my review though you already know that presumption wasn t quite true the 15-inch samsung series 9 is a gorgeous machine but in an attempt to stretch the thin form factor to larger dimensions samsung wound up with a wobbly hinge dull speakers and an unremarkable screen when i got the chance to test the smaller cheaper 13-inch version of samsung s flagship notebook with intel s newer ivy bridge processors to boot i leapt at the opportunity to find out if it could make up for its larger relative today we re looking at the 1 299 samsung series 9 with standard specs a

review pictures previous next view full gallery previous next jdocument.readyfunction j gallery2925972 .gallery i could practically point you to my review of the 15-inch version for a discussion of the samsung series 9 s exterior it s almost exactly the same before you skip ahead though know that it and by extension the 13-inch model are probably the most beautiful laptops i ve ever seen the way the light plays across the series 9 s surfaces is truly a marvel to behold the deep dark blue matte aluminum texture soaking up the rays to make the notebook seem impossibly slim while the shiny brushed aluminum rim that forms the series 9 s entire profile practically glows by comparison the way the lid and body meet they almost look like a single piece and as you d expect the 13-inch series 9 looks even better it s a supermodel of a windows pc acer claimed its aspire s5 was the thinnest ultrabook in the world but the 13-inch series 9 has it beat samsung s notebook measures just over half

none in the palmrests and only the slightest bit of give in the bottom of the chassis and the lid enough to let you feel that they re constructed from thin metal rather than solid and crucially the hinge is strong enough to hold up the screen without wobbling it s still not an exceptionally strong hinge but the result is that the screen is easy to open and stays at the angle you want and i couldn t say either about the laptop s larger brother the 13-incher has only a single usb 3.0 port on the left side along with a micro hdmi jack the power socket and the spot for an included ethernet dongle while the right side has a usb 2.0 port a spot for a vga dongle sold separately a 3.5mm headset jack and a tiny microphone hole that s not a heck of a lot of connectivity just take a look at what acer stuffed into the aspire s5 but the lack of full-size ports does make far more sense here than on the larger 15-inch machine i long for full-size hdmi and ethernet ports but i was extremely happy to see that samsung s clever sd card slot returns here it s a spring-loaded door built right into the curve of the chassis such that you can place a card there and leave it there without it sticking out past the edge of the case and worrying about how it might break off screen / speakers screen and speakers indoors or outdoors this screen is sweet about a year ago i asked an executive at a laptop manufacturer why they always seemed to insist on glossy reflective screens he told me that it all came down to the bezel nobody wanted to see an ugly bezel on store shelves he claimed and that s why edge-to-edge glass designs were in fashion if i d seen the series 9 before then i would have had quite the comeback not only is samsung s 13.3-inch display a pixel-dense 1600 x 900 resolution pls panel with nice wide viewing angles and good color reproduction but it s matte too you can take it outdoors and still have a snowball s chance in hell of seeing what you re doing that s also partially due to the above-average 400 nits of brightness samsung offers here you know what the combination of a particularly bright matte screen and a contrasting dark matte bezel instead of the typical glossy plastic means you can hardly see that bezel when the screen s turned on score two for matte screens and one for this well-above-average display it s still not the very best i ve seen in this price range the 1 399 asus zenbook ux31a s matte 1080p ips panel blew me away but it s good bright a far cry better than samsung s 15-inch display and doesn t suffer from any backlight bleeding issues like the asus screen continuing the theme of better than the 15-inch version the speakers here aren t bad they can still be rather tinny have little bass and can get muffled easily since they point down but they ve got surprisingly full mids and are really quite passable as laptop speakers go vampire weekend s taxi cab sounded pretty good as did dido s sand in my shoes but a number of other pieces sounded rather muddy and distorted samsung s using some audio enhancement software here and it gets a bit overzealous with more complex tracks keyboard / touchpad keyboard and touchpad i ve nothing but praise for the laptop s overall aesthetic but the keyboard is a different story if memory serves it s a teensy bit quieter than the clicky one on the 15-inch model but it s just as stiff and shallow if you ve taken a good look at the current crop of ultrathin laptop keyboards and asked why are these so thick then perhaps the series 9 is for you but i think vast majority of users would probably feel some finger fatigue after using the laptop for a while as with all my reviews i wrote this entire article you re reading on the laptop itself and here it felt like a chore the beginning of a keypress takes more pressure than you expect and then as soon as you hit that threshold the key harshly bottoms out on the plus side the soft aqua keyboard backlighting is classy and unobtrusive just bright enough to do the job and the handy function keys are joined by a dedicated fn lock button so you can let you adjust all your primary laptop settings with a single press each rather than holding down fn each time you want to change brightness or volume one nitpick is that goes for the arrow keys as well since they re mapped to home end page up and page down you might find yourself skipping across a document when you just meant to move a single line or character along samsung s touchpad has absolutely improved since the last time i saw it and though the elan software still has its quirks it s one of the best i ve used on a windows laptop and approaching apple quality the textured glass surface is pitch-perfect my fingers slide across it like figure skaters on freshly zamboni d ice and both single-finger tracking and two-finger scrolling work extremely nicely palm rejection still has a ways to go but it s not as much of a concern as it is on other laptops because samsung neatly sinks the trackpad a ways into the frame the physical button underneath the pad isn t overly difficult to press though i still prefer discrete buttons and single-finger taps are nice and responsive unlike how they were in march on the 15-incher so what s wrong elan s software simply can t keep up pinch to zoom isn t detected well and there s an extremely noticeable delay before it takes effect inertial scrolling is ugly if you swipe up quickly with two fingers in a webpage or document it simply stutters along a few lines at a time like it s spasming there s also a single finger drag-and-drop function which is on by default and you might want to turn it off i found that it liked to grab my browser tabs any time i put the cursor near them and wouldn t let go until i asked nicely last but not least when i bogged down the machine by launching a hefty program or loading a dozen browser tabs at once i noticed that the entire touchpad stopped responding reliably to input until the load on the processor ceased i don t know why this is but samsung and elan still have a short ways to go to reach parity with apple s excellent trackpad comfort obviously wasn t priority one performance and software performance and software there are two models of the 13-inch samsung series 9 but the only difference is the operating system the 1 299 np900x3c-a01 has windows 7 home premium while the 1 399 np900x3c-a02 has windows 7 professional both come standard with a 17w 1.7ghz core i5-3317u processor that turbos up to 2.6ghz 4gb of ddr3 ram a 128gb sandisk u100 solid state drive a dual-band intel 802.11 a/b/g/n wi-fi module and integrated intel hd 4000 graphics update samsung just released a new model the 1 699 np900x3c-a04us has a 1.9ghz core i7 processor and a 256gb solid state drive though the dual-band wi-fi is a nice touch and seems particularly well-implemented on the series 9 i m surfing my 5ghz network with better signal strength than any other laptop i ve used in this house that s a pretty standard list of specs for an ultrabook today regardless of whether it s priced at 800 or 1 499 what does that mean the operating system is snappy apps open quickly hd video plays without a hitch.. but unless you ve never used a computer with a solid state drive before it s mostly nothing special pcmarkvantage 3dmarkvantage samsung series

reduced the startup sequence to the point where i was often fully loaded into windows a mere ten seconds after i pressed the power button occasionally it took as long as 16 seconds but that s still speed demon territory just as impressive was how long it took for the series 9 to wake from sleep as often as not the system took just one and a half seconds to resume what i were doing incredibly quick boots software and gaming samsung s got a fairly clean install of windows 7 with just the omnipresent pop-up laden antivirus bing bar and wildtangent pay-to-play game suite and a small handful of samsung apps on top of the stock os compared to the 1 399 asus zenbook ux31a i recently reviewed another premium ultrabook that s a marked relief and the software load here doesn t seem to impact performance the truly surprising part is that one piece of samsung s software actually improves upon windows 7 and i wouldn t characterize it as bloatware at all easy settings lets you control a whole variety of computer settings including wireless networking power consumption keyboard backlighting usb charging display colors and more all from a single well-organized pane of options accessible by pressing f1 without discrete graphics you probably won t be doing a lot of gaming on the series 9 my benchmark favorite just cause 2 wasn t playable at native resolution even at the lowest graphical settings available if you look to even older or less intensive games like tom clancy s hawx or portal 2 though the intel hd 4000 graphics can do the job i was narrowly able to play hawx in directx9 mode at native resolution and max settings and counted 30 frames per second on average battery life / heat / noise battery life heat and noise even if the series 9 could game though you probably wouldn t want to do it for long shortly after i measured that 30fps framerate my fingers noticed that the laptop was literally burning hot to the touch when i whipped out a temperature gun i found that the aluminum surface had reached 130 f with the processor under full load while the laptop quickly cooled to a slightly more reasonable 96 f when i stopped my gaming benchmarks uncomfortably warm surfaces seem to be a theme for this machine if your palms sweat easily like mine do you might want to look elsewhere the two tiny fans are nice and quiet but they don t kick in until the laptop is much warmer than it should be and they don t move enough air to cool it down when the system is fully loaded anyways the odd part is that samsung actually has a function called silent mode mapped to the f11 key which supposedly turns down the fans to deaden their sound but the fans are so quiet and run so rarely that it doesn t make sense to turn on battery life is a little below average for an ultrabook though i suppose it isn t surprising given the thinness of the 13-inch machine while the 15-inch model has room for an 8400mah pack samsung only fit managed to fit 5800mah worth of lithium polymer chemistry goodness into the 13-inch chassis i got 5 hours 19 minutes on our verge battery test which cycles through a series of popular websites and high-res images via wi-fi with the screen set to 65 percent brightness and about four and a half hours during a real work day which for me consists of dozens of auto-refreshing browser tabs multiple push email accounts streaming audio in the background lots of typing and some video clips here and there we didn t try frying an egg on the series 9 but i wouldn t be surprised battery life samsung series 9 13-inch mid-2012 5 19 lenovo

strong stunning design excellent matte screen half an inch thick bad stuff runs uncomfortably hot stiff keyboard no upgrades samsung nearly nails the gold.. but will take bronze home samsung s 13-inch notebook is better than its big brother in almost every single way and if we were to judge the design alone i d argue it comes close to the high bar apple set with the 13-inch macbook air it s a truly stunning piece of kit and the screen is a cut above everything else equal i d say it would be worth the 100 premium over apple s 1 199 laptop unfortunately just like with the 15-inch model samsung focused on beauty rather than comfort you could get used to the thinner stiffer keyboard but combined with sweaty surfaces and merely average battery life it s not the amazing portable companion it could have been if you want comfort and style hp s 1 399 envy 14 spectre is still your best bet though you gain a load of bulk and weight dell s xps 13 is a comfortable lightweight alternative though it has a terrible screen lenovo s thinkpad x230 and the hp folio 13 have our recommendation if you need a notebook with full-size ports and battery life to spare but neither will turn heads just imagine if samsung had given the series 9 a little more room for a bigger battery a deeper keyboard and ways to dissipate all that hot air sure it wouldn t have been the thinnest ultrabook in the

samsung series 9 debuted before the word ultrabook had even been coined by intel it was a proto-ultrabook a thin-and-light 13-inch laptop that looked like a windows variation of the macbook air clad in black duralumin the original 2011 series 9 was far from affordable for a laptop -- it actually exceeded the cost of an air at the time by several hundred dollars -- but few who saw it didn t lust after it we actually got a sneak peek at the new 2012 series 9 back in january but it s taken until now for samsung s elite laptop to become a reality after a long wave of ultrabooks and the debut of new intel processors the new series 9 is sleeker lighter and more affordable than last year s version still at 1 299 it s 100 more than the entry-level 13-inch macbook air and it s considerably more expensive than the average 2012 windows ultrabook sticker price of 999 or less even though samsung doesn t call the series 9 an ultrabook on the box it is one unboxing the samsung series 9 ultrabook i reviewed the 15-inch version of the new samsung series 9 with the older second-generation intel core i5 processor this spring and found its reduced footprint and bezel gave the laptop the feel of a thin 14-incher the same is true for the 13-inch series 9 the entire footprint is smaller making the laptop feel almost like a 12-incher it s the thinnest and lightest ultrabook i ve ever seen sorry acer aspire s5 that even includes you what are the new series 9 s drawbacks it s hard to think of any excellent battery life superb build quality and a bright high-resolution 1 600x900-pixel screen in a 2.6-pound frame make the new series 9 a perfect portable hybrid and one of the most impressive ultrabooks of the year table.geekbox th table.geekbox tr.even .ratinggood .ratingaverage .ratingbad

series 9 it s even called new series 9 on the laptop itself feels leaner tighter and less physically flexible than its 2011 predecessor a clean smooth hinge and an extremely thin flat form make this 0.5 inch-thin laptop feel smaller than any other 13-incher around including the 2012 macbook air and it is at 2.6 pounds the series 9 weighs less and is slightly thinner at its thinnest point than the new acer aspire s5 the dell xps 13 or the 13-inch air it s not as small or light as an 11-inch air 2.34 pounds but it s close only the sony vaio z at 2.5 pounds matches it in the 13-inch category based on laptops we ve seen this year credit sarah tew/cnet the new series 9 is made out of a solid piece of aluminum lending it the same rock-solid feel as apple s laptops and avoiding some of the flexible feel of the last-gen series 9 it s the same construction concept that went into the new 15-inch version but on a smaller scale the profile is blade-thin with a steely metallic edge that wraps around the sides the outer surfaces are a matte dark steel blue and attract finger smudges way too easily keep a cloth handy credit sarah tew/cnet matching the ultraportable feel of the new series 9 the included charger is equally slight...except that the narrow plug that jacks into the laptop pokes straight out and the cable itself is thick the 12.3x8.6-inch footprint is smaller than that of the average 13-inch laptop too so it s easier to slip into a smaller bag that also means a little less palm rest surface area which i could feel when typing up this review any narrower and it would be frustrating credit sarah tew/cnet the shallow raised keyboard has a similar key feel to the macbook air and to some degree the sony vaio t the typing experience falls in between the two better than the vaio t not as good as the air the keyboard is backlit but the pale-blue lighting is so subtle that you might not notice it s there except in a very dark room the upper keys volume controls screen brightness require holding down the fn key to activate credit sarah tew/cnet the large wide multitouch clickpad seems responsive at first with a smooth matte surface conducive to two-finger gestures however the built-in elan software sometimes interacts oddly with the touch pad resulting in icons or windows being dragged or text being highlighted by accident this problem has occurred on other windows laptops for me especially with tap-to-click turned on it s a shame but not a surprising one and yes it knocks the ergonomics of this laptop down a notch the 13.3-inch matte display is beautiful and bright colors and text pop and look wonderfully crisp more so than on the 15-inch series 9 viewing angles are also superb and text can be read off the screen even at maximum tilt the screen is higher-res than many 13-inch laptops at 1 600x900 pixels some rare 13-inchers are full 1080p but 1 600x900 feels like a better resolution at this size the effective desktop area becomes larger and icons are smaller but not enough to be annoying stereo speakers are seated below the front edge of the laptop and while they have crisp definition for music or movies they re not particularly loud in a quiet room it was still hard to hear some dialogue in a netflix streaming movie headphones are still a better option continue to next page 1 2 editors top picks 1 apple macbook

speakers keyboard / touchpad performance chromebox wrap-up comments down close if sbn.openx.istablet else 2012 is the year of chrome os or so we re told when we spoke with sundar pichai senior vice president of chrome he told us that this is the culmination of a long slow march for google s cloud-based operating system one iteration was about getting people to understand what chrome os is another was about seeding it to developers and oems now pichai said google s trying to take chrome os mainstream the company s diving in with two new devices both running a brand-new version of chrome os that s been changed in a lot of important ways there s the chromebook the latest version of samsung s series 5 laptop and the chromebox a series 3 desktop also from samsung both feature the best specs we ve seen yet from chrome os devices though neither is particularly high-powered google s also released the best version of chrome os yet codenamed aura it feels more like a desktop operating system now and google promises huge improvements in speed stability and functionality the company s also launched google drive which adds a key new feature storage to the chrome os equation google and chrome os still face two huge questions one are we really ready for a computer that s entirely on the internet and two can google build an operating system with the right features and performance to get us there we ll try to answer both below so read on joshua topolsky contributed to this review video review video review chrome os chrome os finally google added the os to chrome os the greatest compliment i can pay the latest revision of chrome os is that it finally feels like an operating system previous versions always felt like a lot of chrome and not a lot of os as if the chromebook was just a browser with a built-in keyboard everything s still browser-based but google has clearly realized that people want an interface that feels more like windows or mac os x even if the chrome os vision is for something different setting up your chromebook or chromebox is dead simple turn the device on log in with your google account that s it if you ve enabled chrome sync your bookmarks and apps will automatically be loaded onto your device and either way you ll be logged into all the google services using the credentials you supplied at the beginning browser tabs meet app windowsof course everything in chrome os still happens in a chrome window so the basic idea hasn t changed much but window management has been totally redone and you can now manage chrome apps and windows just as you would windows or mac apps tabs and windows can be moved around and re-sized and there s an aero snap-like feature that lets you drag a window over to the right or left edge and have it automatically resize to fill half the screen dragging a tab out to form its own window is simple and setting up a dual-window side-by-side workflow which i use almost all the time is a cinch chrome os is still just bookmarks masquerading as native apps apps open in one of four ways as a regular tab in the current window as a pinned tab as a full-screen chromeless window or as a normal-sized chromeless window the latter two are the important new additions they let you open web apps that feel like native apps with no address bar or browser toolbars on my mac i typically run anywhere from four to ten fluid instances at once so i can quickly switch to my gmail without thumbing through a dozen tabs for instance with chrome os i can just right-click on the app s icon and select open as window to achieve the exact same effect you move between windows using alt-tab or using the function key with three overlapping squares on it it s a quick way to move between a couple of windows but it breaks down if you have a lot of them open you can only scroll forward or backward so if you have 13 windows open you ll have to flip through all of them in order to find the one you want a feature like expose which lets you see all your windows at once would be hugely helpful here the chromebook also doesn t seem to know it has a windowing system yet the taskbar is a nice system and a clever way to access apps but if you click on the gmail icon when you already have a gmail window open it just launches another gmail window rather than taking you to the already-open instance i was constantly reminded that chrome os apps are really still bookmarks without some of the intelligence required for them to really run as native apps when i have rdio playing and want to watch a youtube video normally i just press the play / pause button and my mac will pause rdio with chrome os i have to flip through my windows until i find the one with the rdio tab open click over to the right tab pause rdio then go back to youtube and play the video then i have to go back to rdio when the video s done and start my music playing again if you re listening to local music files there s a small persistent player in the bottom right corner but isn t the whole point of the os that you ll do things like listen to music online apps the chrome web store never really made sense to me in a desktop environment but it s incredibly important to the usefulness of chrome os i mostly downloaded apps-as-bookmarks which provide quick access to rdio or gmail or evernote those apps are the easiest way to get the fluid-like apps installed a handful of shortcuts to google services come preinstalled like docs and youtube but there s an app for almost any website you d want to visit then there are apps like google mail checker which add key functionality in this case desktop email notifications to chrome os there are a lot of these utilities which add little bits of usefulness to the browser or help you do more without constantly switching windows but they can be really hard to find the signal to noise ratio in the chrome web store skews heavily toward noise and it s often hard to figure out what an app does or whether or not it s any good printing is possible thanks to the google cloud print utility though you ll need one of a handful of cloud ready printers to make it work anyway i can t really imagine that you have significant printing needs if you re willing to spend all your time in a browser window offline files chrome os is designed to be a totally online operating system but google does make a few concessions to the notion that you still have some files stored locally there s a stripped-down file manager and media player both work well without much in the way of frills downloaded files are stored in a downloads folder and every drive you plug in shows up as its own folder you can manage files pretty easily though i d rather just search it s a shame that there s no way to search through a local drive but apparently that s just one more inducement to upload everything to google drive speaking of drive google s working on implementing it into chrome os in a big way the next version of chrome os coming in just a few weeks will have full drive integration into the file manager so you ll be able to manage everything from one spot no matter what drive it lives on the feature is actually available in the dev channel of chrome os and it works impressively well though are there some definite bugs with the new version the biggest advantage of drive integration is that everything s in one place your online files local documents and external drives are all accessible in the file manager you can also quickly copy things from local storage to google drive which is handy there s not much you can do with your drive files offline except look at them at least for now the docs team is also in the final stages of a seamless offline mode for google docs which would be huge offline support is currently the achilles heel of the chromebook since there s really not much you can get done without an internet connection offline docs support and drive integration would make the chromebook a much more useful work companion a few apps currently work offline signified by a lightning bolt underneath their listing in the chrome web store but they re mostly games or google apps performance didn t seem to change whether i was online or off though which was a nice surprise typekit one of the most surprising things i noticed using chrome os was how many websites use font supplier typekit to provide beautiful typography we use it heavily here at the verge and a huge number of the sites i visit every day use it too i know this because chrome os didn t support typekit and a lot of sites i visit looked well terrible because of it we told google reps about the problem and the company quickly whitelisted the os for typekit so if you re reading this on a chromebook it should look as good as it does everywhere else the fix requires publishers to republish typekit onto their site so the typographical experience is still a little hit-or-miss but the internet should be beautiful again soon life in a browser life in a browser the success of chrome os hinges on whether or not you can live and work inside a browser personally i learned fairly definitively that i can t at least not yet there are apps that i use every day like skype that simply don t exist in the world of the chromebook other apps like twitter irc and google talk have web-based counterparts but they re far below the quality of native desktop apps i also do a lot of photo editing and uploading which chrome os just isn t suited for there s a photo editor but if you want to do more than crop or rotate a photo you ll need a separate app there are online photo editors i used aviary a lot while using the chromebook but they re neither as powerful nor as usable as iphoto or lightroom i suspect i m in the minority though and for most people chrome os would be totally sufficient for email document editing and web browsing the chrome os experience is at least as good as any desktop operating system i d rather use gmail on the chromebook than in chrome on my macbook air once google solves the offline problem which it s been promising to do since chrome os first debuted chrome os could really be a compelling option for people who want a computer that s not hard to figure out and doesn t overwhelm you with options or apps here i should also mention chrome remote desktop beta google s way of comforting you with access to local apps while simultaneously weaning you off them it s basically a vnc client letting you access another computer through a chrome window unfortunately we didn t get to test the service but vnc s a pretty mature system and it should be a nice way to access a windows or mac computer if you feel the urge offline capabilities continue to hold chrome os back chromebook samsung series 5 chromebook mid-range specs more than get the job done samsung series 5 chromebook and series 3 chromebox review pictures previous next view full gallery previous next jdocument.readyfunction j gallery2813209 .gallery hardware / design the look and feel of the new series 5 chromebook isn t changed much from the previous version at 0.87 inches thick and 3.3 pounds it s no ultrabook but it s certainly portable enough to go in a backpack and at 11.4 x 8.4 inches it s about the same size as last year s chromebook available only in a silvery plastic with a brushed-metal look it s very simple without being quite as sleek as the all-black cr-48 the rounded lid has samsung and chrome logos and there s an intel inside logo on the right side of the touchpad the chassis is much more oleophobic than the previous series 5 and it doesn t really pick up any fingerprints my only real complaint is that the color inconsistencies are so slight the palmrest is a slightly different shade of silver from the rest of the front-facing body and the back panel is yet another color it occupies an odd middle ground between looking like a unibody laptop and having starkly contrasting colors both of which i would have preferred to the shades-of-gray design the chromebook is well-made and fairly sturdy though it doesn t feel at all high-end because its parts are so clearly plastic the biggest change in the new chromebook is the addition of some much-needed ports samsung added a second usb 2.0 port on the right side and replaced the vga connector on the left with a more versatile displayport the latter means you can connect the chromebook to a display via hdmi which is nice there s also a new full-size gigabit ethernet port half-hidden underneath a cover on the left side that flips down to give you access the 3.5mm headphone jack is on the left side and there s a full-size sd card slot on the right at this point the only unfortunate omission is a usb 3.0 port but that s a lot easier to do without than an ethernet adapter there s an hd webcam above the display flanked by two led status lights the webcam looks good enough to be usable but it reminds me of a phone s front-facing camera it s exactly good enough for your face to be viewable for a video chat or a hangout natch and no better display / speakers display and speakers matte displays are worth the tradeoffs let me put this simply matte displays are the best i d never even dream of taking my macbook air outside on a sunny day because trying to see the glossy screen is an exercise in futility the chromebook on the other hand has a 12.1-inch 1280 x 800 matte display that is completely usable outdoors it s a decent display with accurate colors and impressive maximum brightness the tradeoff with a matte display of course is that colors don t look nearly as vivid as on a glossy display and indeed everything on the chromebook looks slightly muted horizontal viewing angles are fantastic but vertically they re pretty awful tilt the screen at a slightly wrong angle and you re left with colors so washed out that it s hard to look at samsung moved the series 5 s stereo speakers from the sides of the laptop to underneath the palmrest where they sit slightly raised by the device s feet blasting sound downward if the laptop is on a desk or table sound diffuses nicely and at least gets loud enough to power your personal listening there s no bass to speak of but sound is clean and fairly clear if the laptop is on your lap or a soft surface like a bed though sound gets muffled to the point you can barely hear it i d definitely recommend a good set of headphones no matter how you re using the chromebook keyboard / touchpad keyboard and touchpad chrome os has its own keyboard the chrome os keyboard hasn t changed much from generation to generation and the chiclet-style keyboard is as good as ever with well-spaced square keys that offer good feedback and travel the black keys themselves feel a little cheap but they work well and i was used to using it in no time unfortunately the keyboard still isn t backlit which led to a couple of serious tests of my touch-typing ability in dark rooms the keyboard layout is what s really useful here though the 26 letter keys and 10 number keys are the same as ever but everything else has been re-considered and many keys have been changed there s no function row instead the keys are chrome os functions like forward and back in the browser or to toggle full screen some of the icons are a bit inscrutable but they re really handy and the chosen functions were picked well caps lock has been replaced with search which just opens a new tab and puts the cursor in the address bar you can re-map it back to caps lock though if you ever need to yell at someone on the internet the left-side control and alt buttons are enormous which is again smart since those two are required for almost every typical chrome shortcut all of which work here as well i ve come to expect terrible touchpads on non-apple laptops almost no one else has figured out how to make a good one so i was pleasantly surprised by the chromebook s the matte touchpad / clickpad is smooth and responsive and since the whole pad clicks you ll never be hunting for a mouse button you right-click by tapping with two fingers which i had to explain to everyone who used the chromebook but works quite well once you know to do it you also scroll by dragging two fingers up or down similar explanation required similarly useful feature scrolling s still a bit stuttery and slow in chrome itself but that s more of a software issue than a touchpad problem by default the trackpad s a little slow but fortunately you can change it to be extremely fast if you want if you don t like the keyboard or mouse you can always plug in an external device but you ll lose a lot of the function keys that s one of the unfortunate things about the chromebox that it doesn t have a chrome os-friendly keyboard there s also no bluetooth in the chromebook so an external mouse or keyboard will take up one of your precious usb ports performance performance and battery life general performance killed the appeal of the last chromebook it just couldn t hold up under a heavy workload the new series 5 is powered by a 1.3ghz dual-core intel celeron 867 processor and 4gb of ram and though those aren t exactly bleeding-edge specs they re more than up to the task of powering chrome os i frequently had rdio playing in the background three or four windows open totaling 20 or so tabs and a handful of site-specific apps running and the chromebook never once slowed down i never even had a tab crash and i m all too used to seeing the this page crashed frowny face on desktop browsers the device is also really quiet there s a fan inside but i only heard it if i put my ear right up to the computer i did eventually get the chromebook to slow down and stutter a bit but it required playing angry birds and cargo bridge simultaneously while streaming three youtube videos and some rdio music and having two dozen tabs open in the background that s not exactly a real-world scenario and for anything like regular use you shouldn t run into any issue at all flash never crashed inside the browser even on heavy sites like we choose the moon flash crashes constantly in chrome on my mac and it s almost strange how much better it is in chrome os bastion is about as intensive a game as you ll be able to play on chrome os and it works perfectly the game essentially populates as you go and i never had a single stutter or skipped frame as i played the game incidentally i m terrible at bastion but that s not really chrome os s fault google told us over and over that the primary focus for this version of chrome os was speed and boasts that the chromebook is two to three times faster than the previous model i have no trouble believing that unfortunately a few games like from dust aren t playable at all thanks to the graphics card likewise the laptop played back local files from music and 1080p movies to photos and documents with nary a hiccup save for a frustrating send to picasa message that would override the play button every once in a while that s once again a credit to chrome os which has come a long way in terms of power and stability the chromebook s internals don t scream impressive but the devices runs seamlessly the most frustrating thing about the chromebook s performance is that it can t power two screens at once if you connect an external monitor one screen will always be blank save for a this screen intentionally left blank message i nearly always use two or more monitors and while it s nice that the chromebook supports external displays it s disappointing that you can t use more than one at a time all the sluggishness in previous versions gone all-day battery life since the operating system is so light and the chromebook runs on a 16gb ssd boot and resume times are absolutely insane the chromebook goes from completely off to connected to wi-fi in about six seconds plus the time it takes to enter your google password and will resume from sleep in two seconds flat the latter continually amazed me i d open the computer up and like magic my music would instantly start playing and my windows would be right there as if the computer had never gone to sleep a light os also makes for long battery life as does the celeron processor an ultra-low power sandy bridge chip as i ve mentioned before i used the chromebook heavily and i consistently got about seven hours of use before the battery died on the verge battery test which cycles through a series of websites and high-res images with the screen brightness at 65 percent it lasted seven hours and 10 minutes that s a very good score and given that the whole chrome os experience is about loading websites it s an excellent indication of real-world use it s not quite up to google s promises of all-day battery life though the chromebook starts at 449 but for 549 you can get a verizon wireless radio built into the device plus 100mb of free data a month you ll burn through 100mb in a hurry and it s only a 3g connection but it s a pretty handy thing to have in a pinch you connect to verizon like you would any other wi-fi network there s a brief setup period the first time you connect and you re forced to set up an account but every time after it s pretty seamless you re prompted to get more data when you re about to run out and if you re in need of a quick connection you can get 24 hours of unlimited data for 9.99 which is really handy in a pinch chromebox chromebox the chromebox was initially revealed at ces and the device is now coming out as the desktop companion to the chromebook as soon as you take it out of the box you ll immediately think of the mac mini a short light square 7.6 inches wide and long 1.3 inches tall and 1.8 pounds it s larger than apple s cheapest computer but the 329 chromebox can still slide unnoticed into a drawer and there s basically nothing to it but a bunch of ports and a power button inside though lives the same os as on the chromebook you ll need to supply a monitor keyboard and mouse i used a logitech mouse and an apple wireless keyboard plus a 22-inch samsung monitor google says the chromebox can power screens up to 30 inches but i also tried it on a 60-inch samsung hdtv and it worked just fine so many usb ports that was the first thing out of the mouth of nearly everyone i showed the chromebox and with good reason the device has two usb ports on the front and four more on the back for that reason alone the chromebox makes for a solid home theater pc just pop in all your hard drives connect a mouse and keyboard and play back anything and everything given that there s only 16gb of internal storage on the device anyway you ll likely want to keep an extra drive handy there s also a 3.5mm headphone jack on the front and two displayports a dvi port and an ethernet port on the back wi-fi is built in too that s a lot of ports but there s no vga or hdmi port which is really odd i had to buy a separate cable to connect the chromebox to my tv s hdmi inputs there s also a three-pronged power port and the adapter no brick necessary fortunately comes in the box powered by a 1.9ghz intel celeron b840 processor and 4gb of ram the chromebox performs remarkably well though that s something of a theme in the new round of chromebooks the hardware was previously unable to keep up and the os itself had some issues but things are much more fluid now it boots in about six seconds and you ll be online in under ten it took me a little longer than that only because my google password is long and complicated the mac mini of the chrome os ecosystemthe chromebox s general performance mirrors the chromebook it s very fast and very stable and i never encountered a crash or slowdown except when i specifically engineered the situation to work a computer as hard as possible in a use case you ll likely never encounter flash sites work well games are fluid and i never once had a tab or window crash since your mouse and keyboard are going to come from somewhere other than google you re not going to get all the chrome-friendly tricks and keys most are still mapped the same you just have to remember that the windows key opens a new tab and f5 switches between open windows the one that s not mappable is caps lock try as i might i was never able to get caps lock to become the search button which adds a couple of steps to every query likewise the shortcut to open the apps list never mapped itself so i always had to click on the nine-squared icon where the chromebook feels like a cohesive piece where software and hardware were made for one another the chromebox feels more hacked together google or samsung could of course fix this problem by releasing an external keyboard and mouse combo for the chromebox and the manual actually alludes to the existence of that combo but the additional expense could be hard to

new series 5 chromebook has a better trackpad a faster processor and a much-improved user experience photo by jon snyder/wired when the first chromebooks showed up they felt more like reference designs than fully baked notebooks google s initial attempt at a machine powered entirely by a web browser the black cr-48 was a developer-only laptop with a slow processor and an unusable trackpad last year brought two consumer-ready chromebooks samsung s series 5 and acer s ac700 both of which were capable but felt saddled by merely passable keyboards dim screens and clunky trackpads with samsung s newly redesigned series 5 however it feels like the chromebook has finally arrived the laptop has gotten a big performance boost its trackpad has been much improved and the design is sleeker and more elegant these hardware enhancements are paired with updates to the operating system google s unique entirely web-based chrome os and together the machine offers a much more refined and complete computing experience the chromebook series 5 550 notebooks go on sale tuesday at 450 for the wi-fi-only version and 550 for the same laptop with 100mb per month of free 3g broadband from verizon as part of the price there s also the chromebox a miniature desktop pc which we re reviewing separately more chrome os coverage gadget lab s first look at samsung s new chromebook and chromebox google s tour of chrome os enhancements wired s review of last year s samsung chromebook i spent the better part of a week with the a new samsung chromebook series 5 550 and i ve been using the previous version regularly since its release last year outwardly there doesn t appear to be much new here the new chromebook has a 12.1-inch screen dual usb 2.0 ports an sd card reader and an hd camera on-board storage is limited to 16gb the idea being that the sd and usb slots can pick up the slack where cloud storage isn t practical the keyboard appears to be unchanged and the weight is the same at 3.3 pounds under the hood the improvements are significant you get a new dual-core intel processor up from an atom n570 and the ram has doubled from 2gb to 4gb and some finer exterior details are evident the screen s hinge is improved and feels sturdier and the palm rests below the keyboard are now brushed metal and more comfortable front and center is the new multitouch trackpad finished off with a slim ring of shiny chrome naturally for which google says it has completely re-written the software stack the result of the hardware and software enhancements is a night-and-day improvement in performance browsing what the machine was built to do is screaming fast i watched hours of 1080p videos on youtube vimeo and netflix without a single hiccup script-heavy sites like rdio and facebook simply fly i typed a few documents including the majority of this review into google docs with zero latency scrolling and multi-touch gestures are smooth and the responsiveness of the ui is exactly as crisp as i d demand from a premium laptop the battery gave me six hours of general web use and a second charge lasted through just over four hours of streaming video it boots up in five seconds and awakes from sleep in less than two the new samsung series 5 chromebook in titan silver photo by jon snyder/wired of course the big difference between the chromebook and every other mobile computing device is that absolutely everything happens in the browser it s all you see and all you get chrome os has been updated recently to include an app launcher a file manager and something that resembles a traditional desktop but otherwise everything happens within the confines of google s chrome browser so the chromebook really only makes sense for people whose lives have already been fully and completely webified if you re a google user gmail docs calendar drive right on down the line then a chromebook isn t going to be a big leap for you but if you re used to the comforts of outlook photoshop itunes or editing documents offline this obviously isn t your game of course the big difference between the chromebook and every other mobile computing device is that absolutely everything happens in the browser about that last point the ability to use google s productivity apps while disconnected from the internet is a biggie and it s one chrome os currently lacks you can cache docs to view them offline a recent addition to chrome os but you can t make changes however the company does have plans to debut offline editing in google docs in the very near future google says the feature should arrive in time for its io conference at the end of june and i was invited to test a beta build of the feature so i can confirm it works this will make a huge difference in how these devices are perceived as they will become eminently more usable and the feature will just show up chrome os updates are delivered over the air so all you have to do is open the lid and log in the hardware isn t perfect the screen could be sharper and brighter i found myself consistently boosting the font size a notch or two and using the laptop in bright light isn t as pleasant even with the screen s matte finish and the speakers oddly located under the keyboard and facing down are laughable then there s the price starting at 450 it s probably too steep yes the hardware is nice and the improvements over last year s model which debuted at 450 and now sell for 350 are obvious but the chromebook with its limited functionality and paltry storage is closer to a 500 tablet with a keyboard than a 500 windows laptop most tablets can t exactly match the series 5 s performance but they are more versatile since they can run apps tablets are far more portable too and can make use of bluetooth keyboards when needed right now the nicest chromebook and the nicest tablet cost about the same google says intel is bullish on the chromebook platform and that the companies expect more devices at lower price points to roll out in the coming months so this isn t the last we ll hear or see of the chromebook but it is likely the platform s flagship for 2012 a premiere device at a premium price given the quality of samsung s hardware i can still recommend it even at around 500 but beware it s only a smart buy for people who want the comfort and performance of a nice laptop and won t be inconvenienced by an entirely cloud-based environment or feel limited by the total lack of the legacy pc stuff if you re already a web-head this is a very nice surfboard wired updated design with a complete and much needed redo on the trackpad excellent video performance smooth scrolling and snappy input six hours of battery login screen great for multi-user environments and all your bookmarks and history can be synced over-the-air updates mean new capabilities just show up tired no big disks no keyboard backlight no dvd drive no bluetooth no other traditional laptoppy stuff speakers stink screen is dim and lacks sharpness could be lighter the whole just the web thing doesn t fly for everyone '),(426,'2012-05-29 00:00:00',4.5,88,' slide 2 slide 3 slide 4 slide 5 slide 6 slide 7 slide 8 slide 9 slide 10

chromebook one year after the debut of the first wave most people still don t know what it is the concept sounds cutting-edge instead of windows or mac os just run a light browser-based operating system that offers access to the full range of cloud-based applications and services including those of google s own capable ecosystem gmail google docs google drive calendar and the like and do it all on a thin and light 12-inch laptop that swaps features no hard drive no cd drive for good battery life indeed the name chromebook comes from the fact that the laptop is running the so-called chrome os -- basically an embedded version of google s chrome web browser if you ve used the chrome browser on windows or mac you know that it asks you to log in and then it syncs your bookmarks google identity google docs and google drive files the chromebook works the same way except there s no way out of that browser apps can run on a chromebook but they re web apps they load through the browser credit sarah tew/cnet that s not to say the chromebook can t do anything offline it can read files and play movies and music anytime and chrome os has gotten better at file compatibility powerpoint word docs excel files zip files and pdfs all load well and look great you can t edit documents without first uploading to google docs though photos can be viewed and even lightly edited with brightness and contrast adjustments rotation and cropping the files can be resaved or uploaded to picasa our experience with the samsung series 5 chromebook last year left us underwhelmed it had smoothly running hardware and a clean operating system but with such a limited set of uses compared with windows a high sticker price of over 400 and the requirement of being online to use most apps like google docs the chromebook didn t add up to a logical choice for anyone other than a google cloud devotee a year later the new samsung chromebook series 5 550 has slightly improved hardware and

android tablet like the asus transformer pad or a fully featured 11-inch ultraportable laptop like the amd-powered hp dm1z if the chromebook were 99 this could have been a revolutionary product as it

confusing numbering isn t as easy to understand as android s candy shop-flavored updates not by a long shot file support a complaint we had from last year is much improved with the ability to handle more file types and even zipped files that s no surprise to anyone who already uses gmail or google docs and the end result helps the chromebook experience still you re limited as to what you can do with those files downloading a word doc to the chromebook s internal storage gives you a read-only document same goes for powerpoint and excel images can be lightly edited files stored on an sd card or usb flash drive get treated the same way it s not easy to attach these files to an e-mail either nor can you simply drag files across to an sd card even when in the file manager viewing window apple s ios may not show you a centralized file storage system but chrome os doesn t do anything with the opportunity you can hit control-c to copy and control-v to paste files from internal storage to an sd card and vice versa but it s not intuitive similarly clicking on a document doesn t automatically import it into google docs you can upload files from an sd card usb drive or internal storage via google docs and drive i was able to upload videos pictures pdfs and word and excel docs but you d have to broker the upload via the web app chrome os supports zip txt pdf html mp4 m4v m4a mp3 ogv ogm ogg oga webm wav and most image file types according to google that proved true in my tests external drives can be read as well with ext2 ext3 ext4 fat udf hfs plus iso9660 read only and ntfs file formats supported credit sarah tew/cnet the chrome web store where any apps are downloaded from is also improved in offerings from a year ago you can get a surprising number of apps here games entertainment and productivity apps can be downloaded many for free but they all launch from within a browser frame...because they re all essentially web apps some can be used offline like angry birds which launched fine with wi-fi off once the game had been downloaded for offline use the offline experience as a whole is still best defined as a mixed bag the kindle s cloud reader claims an ability to locally download and pin a book for offline reading but sometimes the chrome app didn t open again when i went offline an included scratchpad app for offline note-taking sometimes loaded offline and sometimes produced an endless spinning wheel some chrome apps didn t run on this chromebook even when it was online ubisoft s from dust a much-heralded game has a chrome web app it s meant for laptops and desktops with dedicated graphics though running it on this chromebook gave me a cannot run error message in the future it would help if the chrome web store at least delineated which apps are meant to run on chrome os devices from dust might be a lone exception but it s indicative that chrome as an ecosystem has its sights set on the browser market as much as the chromebook/chromebox space apps can unlock the power of an otherwise somewhat closed-off chrome os but getting them to do exactly what you want is hit or miss technically that s the same situation you d face on ios with its app store -- finding an app that helps unlock a feature you desire -- but the app store like google play has a lot more options to choose from the whole chrome os user interface keeps trying to make you feel like there s a real set of windows and a desktop there s a customizable background image but this mostly amounts to opening and adjusting chrome windows which all function like chrome browser windows tabbed windows can be split apart and windows can be snapped into a grid or minimized to the bottom dock bar trying to suss out which tabbed windows are web pages and which are apps can get confusing and for me it sometimes led to accidental closing of open programs continue to next page 1 2 editors top picks 1 apple macbook pro with retina display starting at 2 079.98 4.0 stars

improved over the last year to the point where it may be usable as an alternative to standard desktop operating systems but the allure of chrome os was its potential integration with lightweight inexpensive simple computers while samsung s series 5 550 chromebooks are indeed lightweight at about 3 pounds and simple in that their functionality is limited by chrome os they re far too expensive for what they actually provide for the price of a series 5 550 chromebook you can get a full-featured budget laptop like the hp pavilion g6s a netbook or even a tablet with a keyboard like the asus

fiber-laced realization of an idea that was ahead of its time both start at 1 199 for a core i5 processor 4gb of memory 128gb of solid state storage and a brilliant 1080p touchscreen display but each

a 12.5-inch monitor that literally spins 180 degrees inside its aluminum bezel turning the machine into a tablet each computer has its pros and cons so we re putting them head to head in this review

pointed out two months ago acer s aspire s7 is a sterling example of how you build a stunning ultra-thin machine composed of finely textured aluminum glossy white gorilla glass 2 and powder-coated magnesium alloy it manages to be under a half-inch thick and yet feels exceptionally rigid and durable in spite of that i felt comfortable grabbing the laptop and lifting it into the air by any point even the center of the screen it s not only the construction though it s the attention to detail the thin chiclet keyboard matches the perfectly flat aluminum deck so well that it seems to spring from the same silvery metal and the acer logo on the back of the machine is a transparent foil that sparkles no matter the lighting conditions outdoors light reflects off the shiny surface indoors light from the screen shines right through stylish and practical dell s xps 12 is just as likely to turn heads though even in laptop mode the black and silver ice cream sandwich makes for an exceptionally attractive machine both from a distance with its shiny beveled aluminum edges and again when passersby get close enough to see the classy carbon fiber texture on the base and lid dell xps 12 pictures

aluminum rim and push in with one of your thumbs and the lid and screen change places like a revolving trapdoor you can then turn the whole computer around to face you using the keyboard as a stand.. or close the lid to have a full-fledged windows 8 tablet whichever way you choose four spring-loaded pins and some magnets snap that screen in place with a satisfying synchronized click the machine doesn t feel quite as well put together as the aspire s7 as the lid on my review unit doesn t quite close flush and the carbon fiber base tended to creak when squeezed a bit but the screen construction is quite impressive dell managed to route power video signal and wireless antennas through nothing more than the two pins used in the spinning hinge and the company says it s opened and closed an xps 12 screen at least 20 000 times without a problem that s good because i probably spun mine at least a few hundred times during the course of this review it s kind of hypnotic when you re doing some work and suddenly decide you want to watch a youtube video in glorious 1080p the xps 12 really shines just spin the screen up flip the lid down pull it closer to your face and you ll find the volume controls right under your fingers on the left side want to read a website like the verge in portrait mode turn it 90 degrees and a built-in inertial sensor automatically rotates the screen

the process of making these laptops double as tablets neither dell nor acer quite nailed the ergonomics with the xps 12 the problems are weight and size despite a pair of rubber bumpers on the back which give it some grip i found the xps 12 too chunky and weighty to hold in one hand for long and even with two i felt inclined to prop my elbows up on a surface also in what seems like a missed opportunity dell doesn t let you use the keyboard unless the screen is docked in the laptop position on a cramped airplane it d be nice to be able to position the screen directly above your hands while you type things on the physical keys but you ll have to use the touchscreen keyboard instead you ll also need two hands to open the lid because of the laptop s stiff hinge though that hinge tension comes in handy when you re propping up the screen at certain angles even though the 13.3-inch aspire s7 is physically larger than the xps 12 it s actually light and thin enough that you can hold it up with a single hand and that tacky gorilla glass makes an excellent surface to grip i found that i enjoyed reading websites in portrait a lot more with the s7 than the xps the rigidity and 180-degree hinge of the acer also means you can just grab the screen and lift it up to your face with your thumbs on either side to activate windows 8 multitasking gestures acer doesn t seem to have have expected all these scenarios though there s no automatic orientation here so you ll have to hit fn o to rotate the screen 90 degrees clockwise every time you want to change things up more annoying is acer s power button which isn t protected like dell s it s completely exposed on the left edge of the laptop and doesn t take much of a press i accidentally bumped it over a dozen times putting my computer to sleep in the course of writing this review you won t have to worry about either laptop turning on in your bag though both acer and dell keep the power button from activating when the laptop s screen is completely closed acer s hinge isn t quite as nice as the lenovo ideapad yoga s 360-degree assembly which lets you flip the keyboard all the way around but it does have a neat trick of its own it s a dual-stage hinge which starts out weak but suddenly gets nice and strong when opened beyond a 100-degree angle or so the result is that you can not only lift the lid with one hand in a pinch but also have the tension you need to keep it from moving once the screen reaches your desired viewing angle when it comes to ports acer definitely has the edge over dell not only do both models of the aspire s7 have the sd card reader that the xps 12 lacks but the 13.3-inch s7 comes bundled with micro hdmi to vga and usb to ethernet adapters not to mention a cheap bluetooth mouse and a microfiber-lined sleeve the dell has none of these things that s not to say that dongles are necessarily a good idea and neither laptop has a particularly good array of connectivity overall both the xps 12 and 13.3-inch s7 have twin usb 3.0 sockets on the right side right next to one another making peripherals likely to interfere and both put the headphone jack painfully close to the power switch acer s sd slot is exceptionally shallow to the point where you wonder if the card will fall out dell includes a mini displayport for video connectivity which is a decent choice considering the availability of cheap adapters for hdmi dvi and vga but dell doesn t include any adapters in the box the mini dp socket also doesn t double as a thunderbolt port like the ones on apple laptops screen / speakers touchscreen and speakers in many reviews of dell and acer laptops this would be the part where we lambast the screen neither company has a history of putting quality lcd panels into laptops and yet both the aspire s7 and xps 12 have exceptionally good displays both sport 1920 x 1080 ips panels that display nice crisp images with bright whites and reasonably deep blacks that s not to mention excellent viewing angles which come in particularly handy if you plan to type on a virtual keyboard with either screen lying flat on a table if i could only have one of them though i d definitely pick the dell at 400 nits of brightness the xps 12 s panel can get a good bit brighter than the one on the aspire s7 and it seems to display a wider range of colors too also my s7 s backlight flickered occasionally and twice got temporarily stuck on a setting where it washed out the screen s colors i hope that was just a fluke of my review unit on screens as small as these though 1080p isn t universally a plus for one thing though the touch responsiveness of both acer and dell was good the touchscreen buttons are physically smaller so you have to be incredibly accurate with your fingers and thumbs i found the touchscreen useful even in laptop mode but not quite as useful as it is at lower resolution for another i found myself straining to see the text at native resolution when typing away at either laptop s keyboard there are a number of ways you can potentially fix these things such as turning on make everything on your screen bigger in the ease of access settings menu and / or changing the dpi of text and icons in control panel gt appearance and personalization gt display but they nullify some of the advantages of having a 1080p display at all setting the dpi to 150 percent for example made desktop objects look rather fuzzy afterwards besides when you do hold the screen up to your face like a tablet you can immediately appreciate the same high resolution that was giving you eyestrain before as things stand it s a bit of a catch-22 the only places the resolution is universally awesome are in apps like internet explorer where you can just reach up to the screen to pinch and zoom it makes me wish microsoft built pinch-to-zoom into the entire operating system when it comes to audio quality there s no contest at all acer s speakers are among the worst i ve ever heard.. and dell s are surprisingly good the aspire s7 uses some dolby home theatre software tuning to make its sound wider but it can t compensate for the muddy scratchy distorted audio coming out the bottom of the rigid metal palmrests at all even when you re merely listening to a person talking on a youtube video or the like it sounds godawful meanwhile the xps 12 with waves maxxaudio tuning sounds fantastic for a laptop the audio can still get a touch harsh at higher volumes and frequencies and there s little bass.. but it comes through loud and clear with some genuine warmth and plenty of stereo separation i actually enjoyed listening to music on the xps 12 and that s more than i can say for most laptop speakers i can see clearly now keyboard / touchpad keyboard and touchpad touchpad drivers need some work if a slightly thicker laptop is the price we pay for the xps 12 s keyboard so be it it s good with nice deep keypresses for an ultrabook and a responsive typing experience across the board the layout is pretty much what we ve come to expect from dell with oh-so-slightly concave textured rounded plastic chiclet keys with a smaller function row up top my only complaint is that the keys are a little stiff but they feel like they might break in after a while that doesn t mean the aspire s7 doesn t have a good keyboard too it s just an extremely different one on the s7 the keys are much shallower with almost perfectly flat keycaps and yet that s not quite as much of a problem as you d expect unlike the keys on the samsung series 9 which were shallow stiff and slow to respond the s7 s keys require extremely little force to push down and are extremely reliable the net result is that i can actually type really quickly on the aspire s7 since my fingers don t have to move as far and yet my fingers don t feel quite as stiff afterwards because they aren t fighting against the mechanism of the keyboard another thing you might notice is that the s7 has no function row to get at your f1-f12 keys you tap fn and the corresponding number key instead and functions like brightness volume and hardware toggles are mapped to arrow keys and letter keys now in practice it works just fine if you ask me the function row has felt vestigial for years and i actually prefer having to press the fn key before activating a hardware shortcut that way i don t accidentally mute things or turn off my wi-fi i just wish acer had used the extra room freed up by the missing function row to spread the rest of the keys out a bit because they still feel a little bit cramped to me both keyboards have different lighting by the way the dell uses bright somewhat harsh leds while the acer has a soft electroluminescent el glow instead i prefer the el look overall but acer s implementation is a bit off the letters aren t lit up evenly so far i d say dell has won a number of these battles but the xps 12 s touchpad is a distinct loss the elan touchpad in the aspire s7 beats the pants off of the cypress touchpad in the xps 12 pointer accuracy gesture recognition overall responsiveness.. you name it the aspire s7 handles it better even though it s not perfect itself while i liked the soft-touch feel of the xps 12 s touchpad it doesn t compare to the way my fingers glide across the finely textured macbook-like glass surface on the aspire s7 acer s touchpad didn t always seem to put the cursor exactly where i wanted it but it doesn t stop and start in fits like the cypress one in the dell every time i used the xps 12 sooner or later the touchpad would completely stop responding for a second or two for no explicable reason and it often confused single finger taps with two-finger scrolling and two-finger scrolling with pinch-to-zoom mind you we panned the touchpad in the xps 13 and dell made things better a very short while later so i wouldn t write off the xps 12 just yet for now though it could be a dealbreaker performance / software performance and software for 1 199 both the xps 12 and aspire s7 start with a 1.7ghz core i5 processor 4gb of ram and a 128gb ssd and both can be configured with a faster 1.9ghz core i7 cpu and 256gb of solid stage storage depending on your needs notably only the dell supports 8gb of memory and that could be an issue sooner than you d think while the acer only uses 0.9gb when it first starts up my typical workload of dozens of web browser tabs push email pandora radio and a few windows 8 store apps quickly pushed the total to 3.3gb the good part is that both laptops handled that workload just fine ultrabooks don t make the best number crunchers and they re generally not going to play intensive games but for almost anything else you d want to do with a laptop they ll do quite nicely their strength is responsiveness with windows 8 and the speed of solid state storage the acer boots in just 9 seconds and about 8.8 seconds for the dell they re fast to wake too at just 1.1 seconds for the aspire s7 and about 1.6 seconds for the xps 12 the only red flag i saw during my time with both machines was one instance where the dell xps 12 refused to boot telling me that it couldn t recognize the solid state drive inside the third time i restarted the computer it worked just fine manufacturers haven t stopped putting bloatware on windows 8 computers but as my colleague david pierce notes it s better than ever before dell keeps it to a minimum here primarily just some intel and dell tools with acer it s easier than ever to remove and when it s relegated to the start screen it doesn t clutter up your desktop the same way windows 7 bloat used to check out our full windows 8 review for more on the new operating system battery / noise / heat battery life

hours out of the xps 12 and just about three hours and 15 minutes with the s7 that s not what we expect from an ultrabook much less ones that starts at 1 200 or 1 399 for the 13-inch s7 i m happy to say that heat isn t a factor with these laptops at all even when running games that push these laptops past their limits no part of the surface got hot enough to give me so much as a sweaty palm noise is another story though while both systems mostly stay quiet the xps 12 s fan makes a plainly audible whirring sound when it starts to heat up while the s7 sounds more like a miniature harrier jump jet preparing for vertical takeoff both can be annoying but the acer is more so our xps 12 review unit also has a noise issue that has nothing to do with a fan the laptop s motherboard makes a

you can buy the acer aspire s7 is a difficult sell if you ve got additional cash acer does plan to sell an external battery pack that securely screws right into the system and should double the

laptop mode the touchscreen makes it easy to work with windows 8 s tiled interface -- something that s not always true when using a mouse and keyboard flip the display and close the lid and you ve got a functional -- though somewhat heavy -- windows 8 tablet while the xps 12 is a good attempt to merge windows 8 s split personality you ll still likely find yourself frustrated when trying to use desktop apps in tablet mode but if microsoft is right and touchscreen hybrids are the wave of the future the xps 12 is a good partner to take with you in the delorean '),(430,'2012-10-23

yourself on the back like that duo the new xps 12 has a screen that swivels at the middle of the lid s sides so it can rotate 180 degrees along its horizontal axis and end up facing out from the back of the lid s frame this allows you to display the screen in what some call a stand mode or else fold the clamshell shut to form a slate-style tablet while inventive the original duo was hobbled by a low-power intel atom processor and never lived up to its potential dell walked away from the duo which seemed doomed to be another too-early hardware leap much like dell s long-lost proto-ultrabook adamo laptops imagine my surprise when dell announced that the duo was back originally showing us the system behind closed doors this summer the new version now part of the high-end xps line has gotten a massive physical upgrade now it s ultrabook-thin with a slim metal frame around its screen and a button-free clickpad the new version trades up to current-gen intel core i5 and core i7 processors along with solid-state-drive ssd storage meaning that in terms of hardware it can stand toe-to-toe any mainstream ultrathin laptop between our preview this summer and now the biggest change has been in the name dell has decided to drop the duo branding altogether perhaps it still has negative connotations and simply call this the xps 12 that s certainly apt for a laptop with 12-inch display but i do miss the descriptive nature of the duo moniker -- now there s nothing in the name to indicate this laptop s special physical features the xps 12 starts at 1 199 for a core i5 cpu and 128gb ssd and goes up to 1 699 for the hardware we tested with a core i7 cpu and a 256gb ssd this is one of the first laptops with windows 8 the new touch- and tablet-friendly os and it s meant to be used as both a traditional laptop and a tablet but when evaluating new hardware and new software at the same time the question is how much of the user experience in the xps 12 comes from dell and how much from microsoft in an apple laptop it s fair to consider software and hardware together as a single company is responsible for both for windows-based systems it s sometimes hard to tell on which side of the fence the faults lie and there are faults even though the xps 12 is a slim well-built and frankly ambitious convertible it works better as a laptop than as a tablet in the closed slate mode it s obvious that the windows 8 operating system still doesn t always know what to do with your apps and fingers the not-metro interface my own shorthand name for the windows 8 tile-based ui works fine but jumping into apps even windows 8-specific ones such as internet explorer 10 can yield unpredictable results for example at this point nearly everyone in the universe uses some form of web-based e-mail but gmail navigation on the small screen in ie10 is tough shift the screen just a bit and the orientation changes with just enough lag to be annoying tapping on a text field sometimes brings up the windows 8 onscreen keyboard sometimes not and it takes several steps to call it up otherwise that onscreen keyboard is miles ahead of previous windows ones but the layout of some keys is counterintuitive and i ran into just enough lag to make using the shift and caps lock keys especially troublesome but these are the same problems i ve found on other windows 8 systems so is it fair to lay them at dell s feet on the excellent acer aspire s7 the touch screen was a secondary experience mainly used for finger-swiping and scrolling on the xps 12 you re expected to use touch much more and as a touch-screen laptop the xps 12 works well folded up as a slate it s still not an entirely satisfying tablet experience table.geekbox th table.geekbox tr.even .ratinggood .ratingaverage

features aside from the swiveling lid the xps 12 shares an overall design with dell s other recent high-end laptops such as the xps 14 and xps 15 all are thin with full or partial metal construction and dark accents when closed the xps 12 looks like any small ultrabook although at nearly 3.5 pounds it feels dense and sturdy the interior is minimalist with only the keyboard and touch pad a power button in the uncommon form of a slider switch is located along the left edge and most other functions from the wi-fi antenna switch to volume control are mapped to the row of function keys the wrist rest keyboard and keys are all matte black with a powdery finish that resists fingerprints and nicely offsets the metal trim along the outer edge the xps 12 s island-style keyboard is similar to the ones found on most current laptops in dell s version the keys have more-rounded corners than most and the top row of function keys is half-height typing was comfortable and accurate and the keyboard is backlit the buttonless clickpad is only used when the system is set up as a traditional clamshell laptop it s a good size considering this is a small laptop and works well for general pointing and navigation but again windows 8 sometimes seems to not know what to do with touch-pad gestures with some apps and web pages two-finger scrolling works well other times it s too fast and jumpy and still other times it s very slow trying to execute windows 8 moves such as displaying the charms bar or calling up the taskbar is a pain on a touch pad and i usually found myself performing these tasks via the touch screen the biggest feature here as previously described is the rotating screen unlike other convertible laptops with rotating screens that swivel along the vertical axis via a central hinge the xps 12 rotates along the horizontal axis flipping end over end this is possible because the screen is placed inside a thin metal all-around frame hinged in the center of the left and right sides the screen mechanism feels well-designed and it stays in the traditional laptop position without slipping dell says the mechanism has been tested to 20 000 cycles and it certainly feels sturdy enough when you want to flip the screen a gentle push pops it out of the frame and it rotates freely locking in again at 180 degrees this leaves the screen pointing out from the back of the lid making it easy to show your screen to someone sitting opposite you the motion sensor automatically flips the screen image over so everything appears right-side-up from there you can push the lid all the way closed so the keyboard and touch pad are inside the clamshell but the display is pointing up making this a slate-style tablet when the xps 12 is folded down as a tablet you can access the onscreen keyboard built into windows 8 as i mentioned above it s thankfully better than the onscreen keyboards in previous microsoft operating systems with responsive well-spaced keys i found the shift key would lag a little occasionally leading to some typing mistakes and you ll have to spend some time getting used to the layout which is slightly different from that of the ipad s familiar onscreen keyboard besides the standard keyboard layout there are also split-key and handwriting options the biggest difficulty i encountered was the onscreen keyboard not popping up when it should have in google docs for example if you need to call up the onscreen keyboard manually it s an unintuitive procedure requiring too many steps slide out the charms bar from the right side of the screen tap

12 meets intel s standard for convertible ultrabooks and it s just a bit on the heavy size among ultrabooks convertible or otherwise we ve seen similar to the 3.2-pound asus zenbook prime ux32vd-db71 it also has a design more in aligned with laptop sensibilities than tablet with a slightly tapered chassis this works well on a laptop as seen on the laptop-only inspiron 13z but with a tablet the lack of uniform thickness is a little awkward unlike the sony duo 11 however it is comfortable to hold with rounded edges and soft touch panels across the underside when using it as a tablet for watching movies or browsing the web it s comfortable enough but you ll probably keep it in landscape mode as the wedge profile puts the screen at a slant when in portrait mode view all 5 photos in gallery the display also has more to offer than just a nifty backflip the 12.5 inch display boasts 1920-by-1080 resolution along with 400-nits of brightness and automatic ambient light sensing and it s also a touch screen tracking ten touch points at once covered with gorilla glass it should resist scratching even when kept with the screen out the audio which gets some software enhancement with waves maxx audio 4.0 is good but not great producing slightly muddied sound the physical keyboard is superb the chiclet keys have the same soft-touch matte-finish coating used on the rest of the palmrest there s also more spring to them than are usually found on ultrabooks and the result is an excellent typing feel the onscreen keyboard is no better or worse than those on other tablets but you ll definitely benefit from having the physical keyboard should you want to write anything longer than a tweet the touchpad also features the soft-touch coating making the touchpad fairly comfortable it s a clickpad with right and left buttons integrated into the surface of the pad features despite the limitations imposed by the narrow confines of the convertible ultrabook form-factor dell has included a fair selection of ports and connectivity options into the xps 12 on the right edge of the tablet are two usb 3.0 ports one with sleep and charge a power connector and a button that lets you check the battery power level on an adjacent indicator on the left you ll find a headset jack volume up and down buttons a screen rotation lock button and a sliding power switch notably absent however is an ethernet port meaning that the 802.11n wlan connection is your only option for getting online and bluetooth 3.0 adding wireless pairing for peripherals you ll also be missing any ports for video output without any sort of vga or hdmi output the only ways to get your content onto a tv is through either a mini displayport which requires an adapter for hdmi or via wi-di which will require either a wi-di equipped tv or adapter like the netgear push2tv this model is aimed at consumers but an enterprise-focused configuration will be available with windows 8 professional and will include bitlocker encryption with trusted-platform module tpm the xps 12 is also outfitted with a 256gb solid-state drive ssd as of now 256gb is probably the highest capacity ssd you ll see offered in consumer systems so it s hard to complain spinning hard drives offer larger capacity but are prone to damage when dealing with vibration and movement both of which are abundant when using a tablet the xps 12 has no optical drive but in this form-factor it won t be missed along with the inclusion of windows 8 and the accompanying default tiles found on the start screen dell has added a few of its own such as a direct link to the amazon store amazon s kindle app a preview of microsoft office 2013 microsoft live essentials 2012 photo gallery amp movie maker and the new windows 8 skype app dell also includes some resources for users like the getting started with windows 8 app dell shop my dell support center dell backup amp recovery anti-virus protection comes in two forms the

service and a year of premium telephone support performance unlike the inspiron duo which was an atom-powered netbook dell has outfitted the xps 12 just as it would any other ultrabook equipping it with the same intel core i5-3517u 1.9ghz processor found in the asus zenbook prime ux32vd-db71 and pairing it with 8gb of ram it s an ultra-low voltage processor designed for efficient power-usage but it still offers more than enough capability for all of your web-surfing and media consumption needs more importantly for anyone wanting to get some work done and take advantage of the keyboard and

because you ve probably seen it before dell pioneered the unique swiveling screen in 2010 as the inspiron duo a hybrid windows 7 laptop and tablet the twist rather than rotate horizontally through a monster hinge on the base dell s hybrid screen is designed to flip 180 degrees vertically through a central axis within the frame of the lid letting the lcd face either forward toward the keyboard or away from it at the risk of sounding glib the photo makes this much clearer than words can explain it the duo was a flop as most windows 7 tablets of the era were but the verdict never really came in on the practicality of the twisty-flippy screen design now that windows 8 is here dell is giving this system a second go the problems really kick in when you flip the screen around and start using the xps 12 as a tablet the swivel screen notwithstanding as a laptop the xps 12 is unusual from the start the 12.5-inch capacitive touchscreen lcd is fantastically bright and the 1920 x 1080 resolution is unheard of in a screen of this size under the hood specs are typical of an ultrabook 1.7ghz core i5 4gb of ram and a 128gb ssd drive peripheral connectivity is limited to two usb 3.0 ports and a mini-displayport jack performance on general apps is very good and in line with other ssd-equipped ultrabooks but graphics capabilities are nonexistent of course given the machine s integrated gpu this all sounds fine and good and as a laptop the xps 12 is largely a capable machine my only complaint when using it in this mode relates to the touchpad it tracks well but it doesn t register taps appropriately double-tapping is bizarrely virtually nonfunctional on the device 9 times out of 10 you ll have to depress the pad fully to physically double-click the keyboard however is quite well made it s backlit though leaky and the island-style keys have a gentle concavity to them making touch typing fairly easy photo by alex washburn/wired the problems really kick in when you flip the screen around and start using the xps 12 as a tablet at 3.4 pounds it s a hefty slab of computer to be carrying around like an ipad outweighing many competing ultrabooks by nearly a pound even those with larger screens it is also loud not the speakers which are adequate but the fan play even a rudimentary videogame and the fan kicks in drowning out the audio track it is also hot the underside of the xps 12 features a long ridge that runs the length of the chassis this ridge is studded with exhaust vents that shoot out copious volumes of hot air the problem this ridge is clearly molded in such a way as to make it easier to hold the device in hand in tablet mode but it shoots that scorching air right onto your fingertips it s the most painful tablet i ve encountered to date as a final insult the battery life is also poor i got less than four hours with a simple video playback and considerably less than that when playing casual games in tablet mode as a laptop i have no real complaint with the xps 12 but tragically it s largely unusable as a tablet this is a real problem given the 1 200 starting price tag in a world of 800 ultrabooks with similar configurations you re paying a hefty

to sit back while hardware partners used their software to make tablets but as the ipad gobbled up the market it became clear that the strategy that worked for microsoft with pcs wasn t going to work with tablets so both companies got in the game google with the nexus 7 and microsoft with the surface google certainly shook up the 7-inch tablet market it s the best android tablet i ve used and the only one i ve purchased and now the company s hunting bigger game the new nexus 10 is unequivocally aimed directly at the ipad s heart and its biggest selling point the nexus 10 s display is every bit as high-res and retina-quality as the latest ipad add in promises of long battery life a bleeding-edge processor promising class-leading performance and plenty of content at your fingertips and the nexus 10 matches the ipad all the way down the spec sheet it even bests its price tag starting at just 399 but how does it do in the real world read on lt cdata lt cdata lt cdata lt cdata quote.nexus

never see coming the nexus 10 looks and feels a lot like the nexus 7 it also looks and feels a lot like the nexus 4 google s quietly built an impressively cohesive lineup of devices over the last several months i do wish the nexus 10 looked a little more like the nexus 7 though particularly on the back the soft-touch steve-mcqueen-gloves material on the back of the nexus 7 is grippy and comfortable and just feels much better than the smooth back of the nexus 10 the 10-inch model even has a small strip of the dimpled stuff at the top of its rear which both breaks up the cohesive look and serves as a reminder of what could have been that stripe incidentally is removable you can pull it off and attach in its place a folio cover for the tablet which is a pretty clever way of integrating it otherwise the back is dominated by a gigantic indented nexus and a much smaller also indented samsung i promise there will never be any question what device you re using and who made it oddly missing though any mention of google on the hardware warm and comfortable in a way the ipad isn tin general this is a really well-built device and in many ways i prefer its design to the ipad the ipad feels very metallic and cold industrial even this tablet feels more comfortable more usable and more friendly in a way its aggressively rounded corners remind me of the touchpad as does its plain face there are long thin speakers on either side of the display and they re perfectly implemented they blend in so well you probably won t notice them but they provide front-firing stereo audio that s both better and louder than most tablets i ve tested it s not great sound mind you only better but i ll take what i can get at 1.33 pounds it s just about the same weight as the ipad and at 8.9mm thick it s slightly thinner when you re holding the device in landscape it s really comfortable but the 16 10 device is so long and skinny 10.3 inches tall vs 6.9 inches wide that it feels top-heavy when you pick it up in portrait the ipad s much more amenable to being held both ways in portrait for reading and browsing landscape for movies and games while the nexus 10 is very clearly designed to be held sideways and used in landscape the tablet s power button is on its flat top edge on the left next to the volume controls just around the corner on the left side rest the 3.5mm headphone jack and the micro usb port the headphone jack was apparently too wide for the edge and it actually takes a small notch out of the back it looks really odd but doesn t seem to cause any problems a micro hdmi jack lives all by its lonesome on the right side and on the bottom there s only the six pogo pins for connecting to.. something there s a theoretical dock using the pins to charge which are on the nexus 7 and galaxy nexus as well but the ecosystem for it is currently nonexistent display display your retinas will be pleased at one point i sat for almost an hour eyes flicking back and forth trying to decide whether the latest-gen ipad or the nexus 10 has a better screen it s a huge huge compliment to google and samsung that i couldn t decide and called it a draw i think the ipad renders text slightly better and the nexus 10 s images popped a bit more but i m seriously nitpicking the nexus 10 s screen is absolutely phenomenal its ridiculous 2560 x 1600 resolution that s 300ppi if you re counting makes text look insanely sharp its colors are really accurate and its viewing angles are so good that i can actually lay the tablet down on my chest while i lie in bed and still comfortably watch a movie in a lot of ways going beyond 1080p creates diminishing returns movies do look better on the nexus 10 than on the 1920 x 1200 asus transformer pad infinity but only slightly where you really feel every extra pixel is text reading in the kindle app or instapaper or even in chrome is just a far better experience than most individual pixels are totally invisible text is crisp and sharp and nicely contrasted it s just great the only problem is that it s a 16 10 display which is just terrible for reading at this size it s way too awkwardly tall in portrait and too short and wide in landscape holding it in landscape and using the two-page kindle view seems to be the way to go but even with a great screen the nexus 10 isn t as good a reading device as the ipad much like when the ipad first got its retina display the nexus 10 s screen s biggest problem is that it throws into stark relief just how low-res most things are a lot of sites upgraded their assets in response to the ipad so they look much better on the nexus 10 as well but it s still glaringly obvious how bad most pictures gifs and site logos look same goes for apps a lot of apps were designed for 4-inch screens with resolutions like 800 x 480 so things like headers and splash screens become a blurry mess on this huge high-res display it s also obvious which app icons are designed for high resolutions like google s apps for instance and which aren t the most obvious difference might be the magazines in google play though some are now hd magazines updated for this resolution and they look absolutely print-level gorgeous others look fuzzy and low-res as with the ipad i expect developers and site owners will catch up but for now the great screen makes a lot of things look bad software software with the new google tablet comes a new version of the android operating system though this one s not enough of a change to merit a new name it s android 4.2 but it s still jelly bean most of the changes in the new os are minor but they show google s still working to refine and improve every aspect of the operating system the most noticeable software change is in the camera you can now operate the whole thing with your thumb via a circular menu that pops up wherever you tap it s really clever and makes the whole thing operable with one hand well on a phone anyway you ll unquestionably need two hands to operate the 5-megapixel camera on the nexus 10 oh and please don t take pictures with your tablet the nexus 10 s camera is okay but not great and probably not as good as whatever phone you re carrying android 4.2 is nice but nothing here will blow your mind a lot of 4.2 s new features are better-suited to a phone check out our review of the nexus 4 for more on how they work on a tablet they re mostly nice without being particularly significant google now is more powerful than ever grabbing information from your email and elsewhere to tell you when you have flights or reservations but it requires internet connection to do anything so you ll always have to be on wi-fi with the nexus 10 gmail has a great new scaling feature that lets you see the whole email at once and then pan and zoom around it but there s so much real estate on a tablet that email width was never really an issue i do like the new swipe-to-archive feature which makes triaging a lot of email ridiculously simple i honestly thought the quick-access settings menu was a standard android feature it s virtually ubiquitous across skins and manufacturers but evidently wasn t built-in before now it is a stock feature via a menu accessible with a swipe down from the right side of the nexus 10 s notification bar you can quickly change screen brightness toggle wireless radios and jump into the full settings menu notifications are accessible by dragging down from the left the only thing that really changed how i used the device is the new keyboard which has swype-like gesture typing built in in fairness it s really no different than any other android tablet you d just have to download swype to mimic the experience the finger-sliding method of typing works great on the larger screen which is too large for thumb typing just hold the device in one hand and swipe around with the other mostly though android 4.2 is just faster smoother and more reliable than ever so while it might not have blown my mind with new features i m still happy about the new version of jelly bean performance performance and battery life i was worried about how all the pixel-pushing would affect the nexus 10 s performance but i needn t have been i m not sure what to credit the ever-improving android platform or the exynos 5250 cortex-a15 processor powering the nexus 10 for the fact that the nexus 10 is the fastest smoothest most reliable and powerful android tablet i ve ever used and i m pretty sure i ve used all of them swiping through homescreens is smooth apps launch a lot faster than i m used to and multitasking is an absolute breeze even with 20-plus apps open nothing seemed to slow down quadrant vellamo glb 2.1 egypt 720p glb 2.1 egypt 1080p

seems to be because it s simply powering so many pixels on our one resolution-agnostic test glbenchmark it absolutely demolished other tablets i ve tested i don t doubt google when they say this is the fastest tablet out there even if you don t see it all the time not everything s perfect yet scrolling in the browser can still be stuttery at times and for some inexplicable reason the screen still takes forever to rotate but apps don t crash nearly as often and general slowness and lag is even closer to being totally eradicated even if it s not gone yet high-def video looks great there s the occasional frame-rate slowdown on 1080p footage but it s rare and it looks so good otherwise that i don t really care the nexus 10 is an absolute pleasure to use even more so than the nexus 7 a tablet i ve also really enjoyed one thing i hate about the nexus 7 is its battery i don t know if i have a bad unit or just bad luck but the battery life on my smaller tablet is miserable the nexus 10 on the other hand is really solid my first experience with the tablet was to spend a day and a half basically doing nothing but work the tablet downloading 20gb worth of movies and games installing apps watching said movies and playing said games at the end of day two i thought oh crap i bet the battery s about to die it was at 48 percent wrap-up compare it samsung nexus 10 8.3 verge score write review good stuff fantastic display fast smooth performance great battery life good speakers for a tablet bad stuff app ecosystem woefully lacking in tablet apps high-res screen clashes with some low-res android graphics materials not as good as nexus 7 all that s missing is apps the nexus 10 feels like google s open letter to developers look how great android tablets can be the company seems to be saying if only you d make great apps the nexus 10 s display is every bit the retina s equal the build quality is excellent and it even has a half-decent set of speakers android 4.2 is more stable than ever and android does a lot of great things ios simply doesn t but you take it out of the box say it s beautiful and fast.. then what apple s tablet has 250 000-plus other apps that look and work great on a huge high-res screen and android s ecosystem is leagues behind the nexus 10 is a great way to watch movies but there s absolutely no way it s going to replace your laptop the way the ipad could yes the nexus 10 wins on price 399 for this incredible display is a nice deal but consider the extra 100 you ll spend to get the ipad an entry fee to the app store and its many apps and accessories that just aren t available to the nexus 10 google s now proven conclusively that it can design great android hardware but until developers prove they can design great android software it s still hard to recommend the nexus 10 over an ipad the breakdown more times than not the verge score is based on the average of the subscores below however since this is a non-weighted average we

a 10-inch tablet its resolution even outshines the retina display on current generation ipads it also has a speedy processor the latest version of android and is both lighter and less expensive than the ipad though it s the same price as the still-available ipad 2 and more expensive than the new ipad mini the nexus 10 s display makes it an ideal device for watching movies reading books and even just browsing the web and google play s evolution from an app store to a full-blown itunes and amazon competitor means there s plenty of media available if the apps you re using are able to take advantage of the nexus 10 s display it s worth considering given that you ll get a retina-class screen for 100 less than the current ipad however the android tablet app ecosystem still lags the ipad s with many apps either unavailable or optimized for phones so be sure to go through your list of must-have apps before handing over 399 for a nexus 10 ');

alert editors note cnet s original review of the nexus 10 was of a prerelease version on march 14 2013 we took another look at the device focusing on software support for its high-resolution screen the now nearly mythical pogo charger google announced at release and checking in on miracast support another feature mentioned at release but yet to actually be delivered we also followed up to see if any performance issues or bugs we experienced at release have been addressed it s the first question anyone asks when they re interested in a tablet is it as good as the current ipad for the google nexus 10 the overall answer is no the ipad is still the best tablet experience one can have thanks to its still unmatched performance and robust app and media ecosystem that said if you have no interest in owning an apple product anyway but are still in the market for a premium tablet the nexus 10 should be at or near the top of your list the choice isn t as cut and dry as it should be unfortunately your other go-to android option -- the transformer infinity -- still has a better back camera a brighter screen expandable storage and comes with a power adapter that s actually proficient at charging the tablet the nexus 10 s stock charger uses its micro-usb port to charge and -- as it turns out -- that s not the most efficient way to charge a high-end tablet overnight charging will be fine but if you ever need to charge in a hurry there are currently no other options google mentioned a pogo charger option at release but has been mum on the subject ever since so why is the nexus 10 potentially the best android tablet its screen is gorgeous and the sharpest around compared with any tablet and it is the most comfortable 10-inch tablet to hold in your hand with a durability that ensures you won t immediate blow a gasket if your kids drop it furthermore it s the first tablet to run android 4.2 which brings with it great new features -- photo sphere which lets you capture a three-dimensional model of a real-world space is one of the coolest i ve ever experienced on a tablet for most the ipad is still the tablet of choice but for those looking for an alternative to apple s much more constrained os google has delivered one of the best yet like the nexus 7 before it the nexus 10 marks a significant step toward a much more competitive tablet market and its design heralds a new paradigm from which all other tablets should consider cribbing asap just for the record in the 7-inch tablet space it s the nexus 7 not the ipad mini that currently reigns as the best small tablet the nexus 10 in all its high-res glory pictures 1-2 of 17 scroll left scroll right design the google nexus 10 is one of the best designed tablets yet at 1.33 pounds it s fairly light and has a slightly concave shape with a subtly beveled back design thanks to its light weight and smoothly rounded corners the tablet never digs into your palms when held with two hands the back is a soft grippy almost rubbery plastic that not only feels great to hold but doubles as protection for the tablet the aforementioned rounded corners have that same rubbery plastic around them the whole outer shell feels almost like an exoskeleton accessory specifically designed to protect the delicate tablet organs inside table.geekbox th table.geekbox tr.even .ratinggood

your kid grabs it also there are no scratchy edges and no fine corners while preparing this review i mistakenly dropped the tablet a couple of times onto a concrete floor and saw not one scratch or dent now i m not recommending you go whipping these things around but i really appreciate how it flies in the face of the ipad s and transformer infinity s luxury tablet design it s actually more appropriate for families willing to share the device but we ll get to how google plans to make that easier a bit later credit josh miller/cnet manufactured by samsung the all-black tablet bears a passing resemblance to the samsung galaxy note 10.1 and like that tablet its bezels are wide the side bezels thanks to the inclusion of dual front-facing speaker grilles are especially so though some may prefer thinner bezels the wider ones here make the tablet easier to hold in two hands your hands do cover the speakers if held in landscape mode but since the speaker grille is also really long -- spanning about 5.5 inches of the tablet s 6.9-inch height -- there s plenty of room for sound to get through also if you re holding it while listening to something you ll likely have headphones on google keeps things simple for physical features on the left edge is a headphone jack and micro-usb charging/data port in the left corner of the top edge sit the power/sleep button and volume rocker

tablet but it s the one above all current 10-inch tablets i d rather hold in my hands hardware features the nexus 10 is the first tablet to house samsung s 1.7ghz dual-core exynos 5250 cpu it uses a mali t-604 as its graphics processor and has 2gb of ram the exynos 5250 was built using the cortex-a15 process and is one of the first tablet cpus to truly rival apple s a5 and a6 family purely from a specs perspective it also supports 802.11 b/g/n 2.4ghz and 5ghz and mimo wi-fi bluetooth 4.0 gps and nfc near-field communication there s also a gyroscope a barometer an accelerometer and a digital compass android 4.0 the second if you ve seen android 4.1 on the nexus 7 visually you ll have a good idea of what to expect from 4.2 it has the same controlled and focused feel that so far only the nexus 7 has played host to on the tablet front it s less intimidating to the uninitiated than the typical android tablet interface and feels less constrained than its original implementation on the nexus 7 credit josh miller/cnet the now-familiar tray on the bottom of the home screen is by default filled with google services apps such as play music books youtube and magazines there s also a folder housing chrome as well as google maps google plus gmail and other services directly in the middle of the tray is the apps button swiping up from the home button and across the apps button takes you to google now google s predictive personalized helper google now uses voice recognition to field queries and displays information such as the current weather local bus schedules and nearby restaurants you may be interested in the thought is that google now will give you information when you need it if it s 5 p.m and you re about to leave work it will conceivably update you with traffic information without you having to fetch it the information would just appear in google now at the right time in my experience google now rarely feels like a useful feature and only recently does it seem to track my history across devices i m still willing to give it a chance but would love to see its benefits be more clearly outlined in future versions right now it feels kind of separate from everything else and would benefit from better integration with the os credit josh miller/cnet the new new there are quite a few new features in 4.2 some interesting and useful others just kind of cool first the gesture type feature is google s native os answer to swype i m not a swype user but i was impressed by gesture type s ability to accurately interpret my finger sliding and determine for the most part what i wanted to type it did however have trouble with the word badass which is kind of unacceptable to me tablet settings can now be accessed much quicker simply swipe down from the top-right corner to reveal a tray of shortcuts including brightness wi-fi settings general settings battery life airplane mode and so on credit josh miller/cnet magnification attempts to take advantage of the screen s high resolution by enabling it in settings and tapping the screen three times in quick succession assets on the screen will magnify in the section where you tapped this is different from zooming which scales images and text and applies anti-aliasing to smooth things out magnify simply makes things bigger it s a nice feature for those with poor eyesight but i was disappointed by the lack of anti-aliasing daydreams is essentially an interactive screensaver that plays when the tablet is asleep and charging you can choose to display a clock colors jelly beans or my favorite implementation google currents stories from your feed will slowly scroll across the screen and tapping any of them opens the story in the currents app credit josh miller/cnet gmail gets a new design and a new awesome feature awesome to me at least when viewing your in-box you can now swipe messages away to archive them as a person who gets a lot of spam in his inbox this well-implemented addition is one of those details that seems small on paper but makes a huge difference in your experience miracast when it was first announced miracast was listed as one of the nexus 10 s key features since then google s pulled back from that support and currently supports miracast only in its nexus 4 smartphone unfortunately there has been no word from google on when or if miracast support for the nexus 10 will ever be announced credit josh miller/cnet multi screen multi screen implements users accounts in android 4.2 simply add a new user from the settings gt users menu and follow the steps to setup an additional user account new user accounts and all content on those accounts can be deleted by the tablet owner the primary account at any time also any other user accounts on the tablet can accept updated app permissions on behalf of the additional account to switch to a new user you re required to enter the lock screen select the user icon and then unlock the tablet this is a less elegant solution than the nook hd s implementation of profiles which allows you to simply tap the user account at the top of the screen select your new user and watch your content change to the new user s content before your eyes also the nook hd lets you to set up multiple child and adult profiles allowing parents to have more than one administrative account as far as i can tell only one administrative account per tablet is allowed in android 4.2 lock screen more information on lock screens is what android fans have demanded for years actually i don t know if anyone s ever said that but it s what google is delivering anyway now you can add multiple e-mail in-boxes calendars and clocks to the lock screen you can also add a widget called what s this song which is a song identifier added to android in 4.0 now quickly available on your lock screen the widget will listen to a song either playing on the device or from another device and within seconds identify said song and conveniently provide you with a link to the google play store to purchase it i can see this being useful at times but it s definitely a weird choice for the lock screen continue

a few minutes and it becomes obvious the two companies have exercised their many powers to get everything right the new device is very very fast it has the highest resolution display of any 10-incher on the market the styling is restrained but attractive the case is lightweight and thin the camera and the front-facing speakers are solid the user interface is mature and polished and the nexus 10 provides the most pleasant experience i ve ever seen on a big-screen android tablet but unfortunately the same dark cloud hovering over all larger android tablets also pains the nexus 10 a lack of apps there simply aren t enough tablet-specific apps available on android and no matter how swift or shiny or sexy your hardware is that really stings it s the apps that make the tablet the same dark cloud hovering over all larger android tablets also pains the nexus 10 a lack of apps apple s ipad which on paper is outmatched by the nexus 10 in nearly every way is still a more compelling product because it has 275 000 ipad-specific apps sitting in apple s app store just waiting to be downloaded touched tapped and swiped it makes the nexus 10 s primary mission jump-starting android s 10-inch tablet ecosystem seem all the more daunting while there are more than 700 000 apps built for android most of them were built with phones not tablets in mind google has been diven to publicly pleading with developers to build the tablet-optimized apps everyone with a transformer pad or galaxy tablet has been dreaming about the nexus 7 google s phenomenal 7-inch device has set a high bar for the nexus 10 asus has already sold millions of units and is expecting to see monthly sales top 1 million while it faces the same lack-of-tablet-app problem as the nexus 10 its 200 price tag gorgeous display and monstrous power make it a more compelling buy also consider the nexus 7 s diminutive size which not only makes it better for using with one hand reading and for keeping nearby at all times but also makes using stretched-out phone apps less painful but on a 10-inch tablet stretched phone apps are non-starters and the software drought is much tougher to ignore photo by ariel zambelich/wired there are dozens of examples of why this is a problem but just take a look at twitter on the ipad it s beautiful a series of sliding panels display tweets user profiles and trending topics on the nexus 10 and any android tablet for that matter you get a stretched-out phone app with tons of wasted white space text is small and tough to read and the overall user experience can generously be described as unimpressive google knows how to make compelling tablet apps look at the google app on both the ipad and any android tablet it s a superior experience with large high-resolution photos and slick side-scrolling navigation that feels more like an interactive magazine than a regular old social network it s a beacon to the developer world this is what s possible if consumers buy the nexus 10 in droves developers will have clear incentive to make more tablet-tailored android apps if more exciting apps are made more consumers will buy large android tablets

microhdmi jack is on the right the volume rocker and power button which are easy to find with your fingers are on the top panel there s a docking port on the bottom that can also charge the tablet but

now a very cool virtual assistant function like many android features though voice search and google now are better on handheld portable devices than on larger ones voice control is more necessary on devices with tiny keyboards and google now s cards focus on information you need when you re on the go android 4.2 is a grab bag of new features including a 360-degree photo panorama mode qualcomm s miracast wi-fi display system built-in malware scanning and an improved notification center they re all useful but none of them are dealmakers the most important feature in android 4.2 multiuser

well-made samsung galaxy tab 7.7 for verizon review pictures previous next view full gallery previous next jdocument.readyfunction j gallery2657440 .gallery the build quality of samsung s phones and tablets is generally pretty high and that trait certainly extends to the galaxy tab 7.7 the brushed-metal back panel feels sturdy and high-quality my only wish is that it covered the whole back instead of sharing space with plastic panels that ring the sides of the tab 7.7 and stretch across the top and bottom it s a little more slippery than the grippy panel on the back of the recent galaxy tab 7.0 plus but it certainly feels more high-end than the plastic backs samsung s typically known for at 7.87mm thick the tab 7.7 is barely a tenth of a millimeter thicker than the toshiba excite 10 le the thinnest tablet we ve seen yet and toshiba would do well to take a page from samsung s book with regards to build quality toshiba trades quality for thinness in ways samsung obviously doesn t have to the tab 7.7 is much thinner than the 7.0 plus and at 12 ounces it s almost exactly the same weight despite being physically much larger it s really comfortable to hold even in one hand and the way the sides taper slightly toward the back feels just right if you re holding the tablet vertically the power button and volume controls are on the right side of the tablet next to the ir blaster more on that below as is all too often the case the buttons are located really close together so i often turned the device off when i meant to just turn up the volume and vice versa the microsd and sim card slots sit on the left side covered by port flaps i hate port flaps there s a headphone jack on top and two speakers on the bottom flanking the proprietary dock connector that is used for charging and syncing the tab 7.7 and most other samsung tablets the front and back house a total of five big logos and two camera lenses which interrupt an otherwise sleek cohesive device display and speakers display and speakers super amoled plus is awesome but it s no retina display next to the new ipad s stunning 2048 x 1536 retina display every other device is currently competing for a distant second place in the category that said the galaxy tab 7.7 s 1280 x 800 super amoled plus display makes a really good case for that number two slot it s gorgeous with incredibly deep blacks and vibrant colors it does tend to give everything a slightly warm tint so things look a little too orange and red but it s not a terrible effect and it certainly makes colors pop viewing angles are excellent with almost no discoloration even far off-axis and it s bright enough to be somewhat readable even in sunlight though like most amoled panels it s still not great super amoled plus displays can be found in some of samsung s best phones like the galaxy s ii and when we ve reviewed those phones we ve normally only disliked them for being low-resolution typically 800 x 480 1280 x 800 is on the other hand a totally acceptable resolution for a 7.7-inch display if not exactly standard-setting anymore and though it s still possible to make out individual pixels or see some jaggies on small text reading or watching videos is much more pleasant on the galaxy tab 7.7 than almost any other android tablet at 196.03ppi its pixel density is a bit lower than some 7-inch tablets because it s just a slightly larger display but i ll take a super amoled stripe over a higher-density lcd any day to a point anyway and the lack of a pentile matrix on super amoled plus is an advantage as well there are two speakers on the tab 7.7 but they only sound like one you won t get much in the way of stereo audio they sit at the bottom of the device as you hold it vertically and they re relatively loud and clear but they get really muffled if you put the tablet down on a table or hold it on your lap their location also means that if you hold the tab 7.7 sideways say to watch a video all the sound comes out of one side anyway which kind of kills the point of having two speakers at all software software i m going to say something i never thought i d say ever ready thank goodness for touchwiz samsung s skin has its share of quirks and problems but layered over top of honeycomb on the tab 7.7 it actually improves the experience quite a bit i could live without the added widgets weird browser gestures and redesigned icons but there s some genuinely useful new functionality added here the quick-access settings menu has been redesigned so you can quickly toggle various power and connectivity settings there s a dedicated button for taking a screenshot finally but my favorite addition is the small arrow in the omnipresent bottom bar which you press to pop up small widgets that run over top of an app there are a few quick things you can do take a quick note or change the song that s playing and then with one tap you close the widget and go right back to whatever you were doing without needing to constantly switch back and forth it s the closest thing to true multi-window multitasking i ve ever seen on android and it s excellent unfortunately touchwiz can t fix the general sluggishness and lag we always see on any device running honeycomb apps and web pages stutter as you scroll the screen always rotates two or three seconds after you flip the tablet and opening or closing an app takes anywhere from one to eight seconds things don t seem to be any slower thanks to samsung s meddling but they re certainly not any faster and that s still a huge problem touchwiz can t fix honeycomb s problems the clues that you re not using a stock google device go far beyond touchwiz swype is installed as the default keyboard and samsung has its own keyboard as well there s also a load of bloatware both from samsung and verizon fortunately other than some verizon-branded apps two backup apps with identical icons and two separate note-taking apps it s mostly harmless third-party stuff like netflix quickoffice allshare and the daily you can manually organize your app drawer and push all the crapware to the end which i appreciate but most of the junk can t be removed completely the best of the preinstalled third-party apps is peel which works with the tablet s ir blaster to turn the tablet into a universal remote peel s a great tv guide-like app that helps you find stuff to watch it uses a setup wizard to connect to your whole home theater setup and then wirelessly controls all of it the 7.0 plus has a similar integration and it s a cool added feature for the 7.7 as well unfortunately apps like peel are few and far between on android the biggest drawback for android tablets continues to be the general lack of third-party apps optimized for the larger screen it s incredibly hard to recommend the galaxy tab 7.7 or any other android tablet over an ipad at the moment simply because there are so many more good apps available on apple s tablet and there s no sign that the balance will shift anytime soon samsung has promised an upgrade to android 4.0 but the company s given us few reasons to trust its ability or willingness to deliver timely updates if and when the tab 7.7 does get an ice cream sandwich upgrade it should solve a lot of the os-level issues and make using the 7.7 a much more pleasant experience i m just not holding my breath waiting for it cameras cameras samsung galaxy tab 7.7 sample pictures previous next view full gallery previous next jdocument.readyfunction j gallery2657426 .gallery you ll look a lot less ridiculous taking pictures with the tab 7.7 than with a 10-inch tablet so it s nice that its cameras aren t terrible even if they re not much to write home about either the 3.2-megapixel camera on the back isn t particularly high-res but does all right and the 2-megapixel front-facing shooter is actually better than its equivalent on most tablets the back camera can shoot 720p video which looks okay in good lighting but it lacks any kind of image stabilization and holding a 7.7-inch device still enough to not get any blur is near impossible making matters worse the lenses themselves are really oddly placed the front-facing camera is slightly off-center above the display so you have to hold the tablet off to your left to frame yourself properly the rear camera is even worse nestled into the top right corner as you hold the tablet vertically it s really awkward to frame a shot especially of something relatively close in front of you the real banner feature here almost the saving grace is the camera app loads of settings are placed along the left side of the screen so changing white balance or resolution is only a tap or two away you can tap-to-focus which i can t do without and i love how easy it is to tweak timers and settings or just flip from shooting stills to recording video a great app for a mediocre camera performance performance data and battery life powerful hardware is held back by underperforming software the dual-core 1.4ghz exynos processor inside the galaxy tab 7.7 generally does its job pretty well whether i was browsing the web or playing a game things work as smoothly and seamlessly as can be expected on honeycomb and even having a number of apps open at once didn t seem to overload it i had a couple of jumpy frame-skipping moments while playing grand theft auto iii on the device and even the most powerful chip can t overcome honeycomb s inherent slowness but generally speaking the device plowed along well our quadrant benchmark scores backed that up too with the 7.7 averaging an excellent 3 300 though that s not surprising since virtually every exynos-powered device we ve tested has gotten fantastic scores once it s upgraded to android 4.0 there should be virtually nothing slowing this device down browser performance is similarly solid partly because samsung finally had the good sense to have the tablet default to loading full websites instead of mobile versions it renders typography and image-heavy sites really well and pinching and zooming are more responsive than i m used to on an android tablet i suspect samsung s cheating on that last point though the browser often blanks out the rest of the page except for what you re zooming in and out on and then renders it again when you stop so you get a second or two of blank space all over the page after you zoom back out the 7.7 does have a tendency to get warm while you re using it especially when you re playing an intensive game the back heats up yes but so does the screen to the point where it feels odd to touch the display since it feels like it s been baking it s not nearly enough to be worrisome but it s an odd thing the first few times it happens the galaxy tab 7.7 connects to verizon s lte network which is terrific news verizon has both the largest and most mature lte network of any us carrier i almost never turned wi-fi on during my time with the galaxy tab because lte is actually faster than my home wi-fi most of the time at the verge office in midtown manhattan i consistently saw speeds between 8mbps and 10mbps down and 5mbps to 7mbps up it s not as fast as the ipad but still quite good and still better than my home wi-fi at points connectivity was solid and consistent if you re buying a carrier-connected device verizon s probably the safest bet right now of course it s important to note that data plans are still pretty expensive and pretty stupid samsung evidently copied apple s strategy of adding as much battery as physically possible into its tablets cramming a big 5100mah battery into the galaxy tab 7.7 it worked too even connected to lte pushing email and twitter browsing playing games and watching a movie on netflix i still got a full day and change of battery life with more normal use this is a tablet you ll only need to charge every three days or so wrap-up compare it samsung galaxy tab 7.7 verizon 7.4 verge score write review good stuff excellent display thin and well-built solid lte speeds great battery life bad stuff honeycomb is a drag on any tablet expensive especially off-contract some bloatware samsung picked everything right except the operating system using the galaxy tab 7.7 perfectly crystallizes how bad honeycomb really is samsung built a solid high-end tablet with great internals and a great display but equipped it with an operating system that s just not up to the task if and when it s upgraded to ice cream sandwich this will easily be one of the two or three most compelling android tablets because samsung did virtually everything else right right now though it s being held back considerably of course the lack of good tablet apps for android is still a huge problem and so is the price 499.99 plus a two-year contract is likely to be more expensive in the long run than a 629 contract-free verizon ipad and 699.99 without a contract is even harder to swallow for a device with only 16gb of internal storage if you really want an android tablet you ll love the galaxy tab 7.7 especially when it gets android 4.0 but without a more stable os it s not the best tablet out there in any conversation ics-equipped devices like the transformer prime are a smarter buy and none of them compare to the ipad the breakdown more times than not the verge score is based on the average of the

wrap-up comments down close if sbn.openx.istablet else when planning my review of the kindle fire i knew i d need two things time and a big list of music movies and books i wanted to dive into i say that because i assumed going into the review that the fire wasn t about to take the place of my laptop the android-powered 7-inch device didn t exactly strike me as a productivity machine at least when you look at the specs and knowing the selection of apps and services i would have access to i planned on doing some serious consumption of content make no mistake about it the fire is a proper tablet with many though not all of the capabilities of something like an ipad but the focus on this product is most certainly on lean-back experiences and that s reflected in the price too but can a 200 mini-tablet take on apple s behemoth will the fire derail the plans of other android tablet-makers and does the release of this product fundamentally change amazon s position in the market i ll attempt to answers those questions and more in my review below so read on hardware hardware / design the design is just incredibly unoriginal the design of the kindle fire is anything but inspired it would be one thing if the device were simply a black rectangle with a high gloss screen spoiler alert it is but what s more striking about the device is just how identical it looks in comparison to a product we ve seen before namely the blackberry playbook i can t overstate how similar these two products seem they are a similar size their dimensions closely match both feature a 1024 x 600 7-inch display on the front and have a plastic soft-touch casing on the sides and back and both weigh 0.9 pounds it s been speculated on and more recently stated as fact by barnes amp noble that amazon used the playbook reference design as the basis for the design of the fire and i wouldn t be surprised if that were true don t get me wrong it s not that the design is necessarily bad it s just that it s incredibly unoriginal still the device feels solid and well made in your hands it s got enough heft that it feels substantial but it s not so heavy that you feel strain when holding it for extended periods unlike the 1.3 pound ipad 2 i never felt fatigue after reading a book or magazine on the fire the size and shape might very well be the sweet spot for many users kindle fire review previous next view full gallery previous next jdocument.readyfunction j gallery2324239 .gallery i am confused about a number of decisions here however unlike the playbook ipad or pretty much any other tablet on the market the fire has no hardware volume controls meaning that you have to go through a series of taps especially if the device is sleeping to just change the volume the fire also has no home button simply a small hard-to-find nub along the bottom used for sleeping and waking the device and powering up and down that means that amazon had to create software navigation for getting around the tablet which would be fine.. if the home button wasn t always disappearing into a hidden menu also i found myself accidentally pressing the power button when i was typing or holding the tablet in certain positions causing the fire to think i wanted to shut it down i m not sure why it s located where it s located but it seems like a poor choice to me knocks aside i do like the general aesthetic and feel of the fire after using this device and then going back to the ipad 2 i was struck at how big and bulky apple s tablet feels this size and shape might very well be the sweet spot for many users and since most people have never seen or used a playbook the fire should be a relatively new experience for them from a design standpoint too internals / display internals / display the fire isn t a speed demon though it definitely holds its own in the specs department inside the device there s a ti omap dual-core cpu clocked to 1ghz the fire has 512mb of ram and 8gb of onboard storage plus wi-fi 802.11b/g/n there s no bluetooth 3g or gps here however while the device has an accelerometer it doesn t appear to have a light sensor at least there aren t any options for auto-brightness on the fire i thought that was a bit odd considering the amount of reading in different settings you ll be doing with this thing the fire has a set of stereo speakers mounted at the top rear of the casing if you re holding it in portrait sound was reasonable from the device though you re probably going to want to plug it in to something via the 3.5mm headphone jack for more serious audio you can charge or sync the fire via a micro usb port there s no removable storage on the fire and the only model being sold is the 8gb version you actually get something more like 6gb of usable space that could be a deal breaker for some while you do get great streaming options with the tablet you re going to be limited to a small amount of content loaded onboard that s going to be a particularly vivid reality if you re an avid hd movie or tv watcher the 1024 x 600 lcd display does a fine job with all sorts of media displaying bright colors and crisp text touch response on the capacitive screen seemed relatively good i do take issue with some scrolling behavior though i think it has more to do with software than anything else more on that below the fire isn t a speed demon battery life / performance battery life and performance i never really found myself worrying about charging the device the battery on the fire certainly lived up to amazon s claim of 8 hours for continuous reading in fact it might have slightly outperformed the ratings while i was using it much like my experience with the ipad and ipad 2 i never really found myself worrying about charging the device it went for days at a time without needed to be plugged in i think amazon could do a better job with letting people know where their battery life is at like most android devices you can only see battery percentage inside of a settings menu on the performance side the fire seems to be on par with much of its android brethren though it s possible that some of amazon s customization is making the tablet feel a little more bogged down than what you d get with a raw android experience in linpack the fire scored a respectable average of about 34 mflops in the browser the fire returned a sunspider result of 2541.9ms not too shabby but compared to the galaxy tab 7.0 plus s score of 1634ms it seems a little sluggish software software of course as everyone knows the fire isn t about specs it s not about horsepower it s about software and services and there s at least one of those places where amazon truly shines you can t question that the company has music books tv and movie options galore but how does bezos retailer fare at creating a siloed android experience the company made a big gamble that it could redesign and re-skin google s os in a way that was more user friendly and cohesive so have they succeeded look and feel to be clear the software experience of the fire isn t wholly disconnected compared to other android tablets or phones you still have some of the basic pieces of the os in place here but others have been removed or heavily altered things that will seem familiar to android users include the keyboard which has been reskinned though works and sounds like a standard gingerbread keyboard the window shade notification area though now it s a tap instead of swipe down and many of the submenus and settings screens there are huge changes elsewhere however for starters there aren t home screens or widgets here instead amazon offers a virtual bookshelf that has two specific places for your content the upper level is a cover flow-style swipeable list which shows you your most recently used items across music books magazines apps and more the lower level is a user-programmable list which allows you to place your favorite selections into an organized grid you can rearrange these icons much like you do on the homescreen of the ipad they automatically reshuffle and the list grows downward as you add more items this is for all intents and purposes your new homescreen and it works rather well along the top of your homescreen is a list of your content silos newsstand books music video docs apps and web as well as a search box that lets you peer into your library or jump to a web search it makes getting to your stuff quick and easy and also blends well with the store options amazon provides one thing i would like to see on the fire is a way to do a unified search of all content available on the individual stores as well as your library right now each piece is broken off and it would be really helpful to jump right into a content search from that persistent search box the software experience of the fire isn t wholly disconnected compared to other android tablets or phones for ease of use and simplicity the general concepts get high marks from me though i do think some tweaking is required one of the more annoying aspects of this screen is the sensitivity of the swiping area it s actually quite difficult to get the item you want to focus and stay still and often a tap doesn t register on those items furthermore you can t remove unwanted items from the list so if you ve visited a webpage or opened an app that you no longer want at the top of the list you just have to wait for it to shuffle off of the front page of your device the pinning area below is a nice idea though i don t see how it differs much from a homescreen full of icons and links to webpages pro observation it doesn t i will admit to missing widgets though there are still some android apps you can download that will allow you to keep toggles or quick links in your window shade area speaking of that area another place amazon has changed the os and improved it in my opinion is that the fire offers a tap point on the right side of the status bar which drops down quick options to set volume brightness and other settings as well as providing access to your currently playing music the fire os does miss a bit with its handling of the home menu and back buttons clearly these are necessary for much of the navigation of the device but unlike ice cream sandwich which almost always keeps these items present onscreen the fire often hides the buttons and demands a tap to bring them back up that can be distracting and confusing when you re trying to quickly get around the tablet additionally the way they re surfaced differs depending on the application you re in sometimes they re brought forward by a single tap to the display and sometimes they re buried in a weird little pull-up menu which hovers along the bottom of the screen most of these issues might have been solved by making the sleep / wake button a home button as well perhaps amazon will provide a software update with this as an option otherwise the os has been generally cleaned up and made whole so every app and menu that you re in looks cohesive and feels like part of the same family things aren t exactly perfect however i did notice some weird behavior on the homescreen where data seemed to be reloading or recaching randomly the icons would flicker out and then flicker back on unexpectedly the navigation icons in apps home back and menu were often finicky wouldn t accept touches or failed to appear when i wanted them to additionally the overall os performance feels stuttery and sluggish there are odd visual bugs and things like the keyboard are slow to respond going back to the ipad 2 from the fire was a stark contrast in fit and finish there s a lot of polish here but i see a lot that amazon still needs to perfect email believe it or not there is an email client on the fire the offered software is a basic but capable imap client you won t find any fancy gmail features here like archiving conversation view or label management but you should be able to deal with your inbox all the same if you re a gmail user you ll be happy to know that the device automatically sets up your mail as an exchange account thus allowing for push updates thankfully you also get multiple message management as well as the ability to view a unified inbox which aggregates multiple accounts generally the email client works well though i couldn t help but fantasize about how good the fire would be with a native gmail client onboard books obviously there s book reading software on the fire and if you ve ever used any of the company s clients for android ios or webos you ll have a pretty good picture of what this reader is capable of and that s pretty standard stuff aside from obvious formatting and re-formatting of width font size and coloring you re also able to select words or groupings of words for notation searches and highlighting for studying and note-taking the fire s client seems superb though i was a little disappointed to find that the company didn t include the innovate new x-ray feature it s touting on the kindle touch i was also a surprised to see slower frame rates on page turns than on ios or android as the new flagship kindle i expected the experience to be a little more polished music and video the music and video playback aspects of the fire are solid but won t exactly surprise you both apps on the device are clean and structured but clearly not trying to win any awards for most innovative i actually take that as a good thing i want my media players to get out of the way and do their job and that s definitely the case on amazon s tablet music is a no-frills affair which gives you options to sort your collection by what s available on just the device itself or your full library in amazon s cloud one thing that s odd is that you can t see both buckets in a single view when playing back music you always have a small controller and listing of what s on at the moment and as i mention above you get persistent controls in the dropdown navigation i did have some issues when making playlists where my selection options would jump around and i wouldn t be able to add certain songs unless i scrolled the list of tracks up and down it s clearly a software bug that needs working out video is a similarly simple affair though instead of starting you out in your library it plants you in a featured front page of store content that makes a lot of sense on the fire and at least in my case because i m a prime subscriber free content is shown in the main slot it s a great enticement to browse around and discover new shows or movies when you view a piece of content you get choices to watch immediately or see purchasing options playback of video was handled in an almost identical fashion to playback on the company s video player for devices and its web player the controls for video watching float above your content and quickly fade away when you re not interacting with the device one interesting thing of note you can t watch video in portrait mode at all the fire immediately switches to landscape when you start a video shopping shopping on the fire where amazon is particularly strong is in breaking down the sense of a barrier between the content you own and have on the device and its various stores where new content is available to buy and stream or download to the fire all of the content silos on the device offer a quick jump into amazon s store where you can browse and purchase new music movies books or magazines the experience is completely painless and far more integrated in the fire than it is on the ipad or any other android tablet if amazon was trying to prove a point here it seems to be working the company is definitely presenting a smoother path to buying content than any of the other guys now i m not saying that amazon s method of displaying that content in the respective stores is superior to apple s i m just saying that the experience of getting there and purchasing what you re looking for is nearly seamless as far as selection goes amazon will seem tough to beat in many departments the company s music offerings are well established and its tv and movie content don t lag very far behind the competition in books and magazines it s tough to argue against amazon though many magazine and newspaper choices here are available elsewhere in nearly identical formats i found magazine reading to be a little cramped on the small display and zooming and panning around lacks a smoothness that would make the experience more enjoyable some titles are offered in enhanced tablet-specific formats the conde nast titles for instance and i think users will notice the difference in presentation with music and movies while the choices may be vast there are limitations the fire relies predominately on streaming to get your content meaning that if your connection is slow or you re out of wi-fi range you re pretty much out of luck you can sideload content but i get the impression that mounting a drive on your computer and dumping files into it isn t what amazon really had in mind when they made the fire if you ve got a good connection however there are plenty of options to keep you happy while streaming is the preferred method of enjoying your content you have the option to download anything you purchase and the process is relatively painless even better the tablet tells you how many viewable minutes of video you ve downloaded during the process of course it doesn t tell you how long the download will take so it s a give and take the biggest problem for most users will likely be the limited storage the tablet provides if you are storing lots of music and movies on the device you re going to have to get into management of those files pretty quickly and that can make for an unpleasant experience minor complaints aside my main takeaway from the fire on the process of finding and purchasing content is this amazon has done it better and more elegantly than anyone else in the space right now and i hope the competition follows suit the experience is far more integrated than it is on the ipad or any other android tablet silk browser silk browser i didn t notice any page load times that i would consider noticeably speedier amazon made a lot of noise about its new browser at the launch event for the fire if you ll recall silk is a webkit-based browser that relies on server-side elements and more persistent connections to supposedly speed up site load times some of the more interesting aspects of the technology involves learning browsing behavior from the mass of users hitting a specific website and then pre-cacheing some of that data based on likely behavior that means that if most people are going to the new york times business page after hitting the front page silk will begin loading that page two data while you re browsing it sounds good on paper but in my testing i didn t notice any page load times that i would consider noticeably speedier when speaking to amazon reps they made it sound like lots of people would need to hammer on silk to start to generate usage patterns still i expected to see some bump in load times and i can t say there was anything visibly different in the experience in fact the ipad 2 and galaxy tab 10.1 had much faster load times on most sites i tested side-by-side additionally much like the standard gingerbread browser the fire suffers from laggy scrolling and imprecise clunky pinch-to-zoom behavior next to the ios browser or honeycomb tablets it just seems less capable there are some bright spots like the use of tabs but overall i was underwhelmed with browser performance third-party apps third-party apps because the fire is on android 2.3 many of the applications offered feel like glorified phone apps as you probably already know because amazon has completely forked android you won t find any of google s native apps on this device including the android market that means that you re getting over 10 000 apps versus the 360 000 which are currently available in google s store amazon has had its appstore up and running since march of this year and it s got a respectable set of applications but that set is by no means complete even though amazon s pr touts flagship titles like netflix hulu and angry birds there s much you won t find here if you ve been an android or ios user from the early days you probably remember what a low-population software selection feels like the fire s offerings start to get pretty thin pretty quickly even some advertised apps like words with friends weren t available at the time of this writing for an os that s still playing catch up to ios and one which is plagued by fragmentation in its main fully supported app store the introduction of a completely separate store on a completely separate product which developers now have to to consider seems relatively awful to me sure there are some great titles available to fire owners but what s the long term plan if the fire doesn t reach parity with honeycomb or ice cream sandwich all of the new tablet android apps will be unavailable for this platform or require a second build which developers will have to maintain and that seems untenable furthermore because the fire is on android 2.3 many of the applications offered feel like glorified phone apps that works sometimes but often it feels clunky and cheap i respect amazon s desire for a complete and clean ecosystem but the divide it s going to cause particularly for smaller developers could have a chilling effect whispersync whispersync you re probably familiar with whispersync for kindle books which lets you leave off in a specific place on one device and then pick up in that same place on another for the kindle fire amazon has extended the feature to video which means that you can now pause something you re watching online or on a roku tv or other box equipped with an amazon video application and pick it up on your fire or vice versa in my testing the feature worked without fail it s a relatively simple piece of the puzzle that many people won t need but for the slightly more connected fire owners i can imagine it coming in handy in all sorts of situations video review video review wrap-up compare it amazon kindle fire 7.5 verge score 7.0 user score write review good stuff great amazon content ecosystem user friendly consistent ui affordable bad stuff software can be buggy amazon appstore has limited selection uninspired hardware there s no question that the fire is a really terrific tablet for its price if you re thinking about getting the fire you have to decide not just whether you want a tablet but what kind of tablet you want this isn t an ipad-killer it has the potential to do lots of things but there are many things i have yet to see it do and i wonder if it will get there given the lean software support it s my impression that amazon believes that the fire will be so popular that developers will choose to work on its platform rather than on google s main trunk of android but that s just a theory right now still there s no question that the fire is a really terrific tablet for its price the amount of content you have access to and the ease of getting to that content is notable to say the least the device is decently designed and the software while lacking some polish is still excellent compared to pretty much anything in this range and that includes the nook color it s a well thought out tablet that can only get better as the company refines the software it s not perfect but it s a great start and at 200 that may be all amazon needs this holiday shopping season want to see how the kindle fire stacks up against the nook tablet ipad 2 and

up with the first sub- 200 tablet that may actually be worth buying however while the kindle fire does a great job of connecting to the amazon media ecosystem it s limited by a paltry 8gb of storage a so-so web browser and a poky processor it s edged by barnes amp noble s nook tablet which offers expandable storage and a sharper display for the same price '),(446,'2011-11-14 00:00:00',8.0,93,' pros

bottom line the first easy-to-use affordable small-screen tablet the amazon kindle fire is revolutionary by sascha segan the amazon kindle fire puts the apple ipad on notice the fire is the first small tablet that average users can pick up and immediately use with a simple clear interface then there s the price android along with amazing specs for just 199 it s open enough to attract geeks too while the user interface occasionally gets sluggish we re willing to have a bit of patience to get a first-rate tablet for half of what most competitors charge thus the kindle fire is our first

customization is really good news for non-geeks android is a delightfully open-ended os but it s too open-ended for a lot of people it s not immediately clear what you re supposed to do with an android tablet it s immediately clear what to do with the kindle fire though start it up and you see seven words newsstand books music video docs apps and web that s what you do most of the rest of the home screen is devoted to a cover flow-like carousel of your most recently used content with four user-assignable favorites at the bottom each of the seven sections gives you a virtual bookshelf of items stored on your fire along with a link to amazon s relevant store yes this tablet is designed to make you buy stuff from amazon you don t have to you can load your own files but it s very very easy to buy and arrange items from amazon s many digital shops and that s great most people are familiar with kindle books which read and sync well on the fire although they don t have some of the new kindle touch features like x-ray summaries there are some new kinds of content in the bookstore for amazon too like color childrens books for example but they show up in landscape format they look like straight flatbed scans and you can t zoom in or out and there s no text-to-speech support there that s a less appealing experience than you get on the nook at least for now sign up for the pc magazine digital edition for kindle the color screen makes comics look very appealing although amazon is still working out how to sell them the comixology app and single issues of various comics weren t available during my test period in comics you can double-tap to zoom in on individual panels but you can t pinch-to-zoom two-page spreads end up segmented and zoomed magazines are a mixed bag you get two kinds text-only magazines which basically look like wap sites or older kindle documents and replica magazines which let you flip between images of magazine pages and the text of the articles newspapers give you what looks like a downloadable version of the paper s mobile web site amazon has said that it doesn t intend to host replica newspapers the music option lets you stream songs from your amazon cloud drive or play files stored on the device to get them onto your tablet you can buy them from the amazon mp3 store or drag and drop or sync them from your pc the kindle fire comes with free unlimited cloud storage for anything you buy from amazon you can store non-amazon files too but you only get 5gb upgrading to 20gb costs 20 per year that cloud storage is very important with only 6.5gb of free onboard storage you can only store three or four movies and some choice playlists on the tablet at a time everything else resides in the cloud locker and you swap items in and out when you need more room video lets you rent buy or download movies or tv shows or play amazon prime s subscription streaming video service docs lets you view documents you ve sent to the kindle s dedicated email address apps shows the apps you ve downloaded from amazon s app store or sideloaded onto the tablet and web loads the silk browser i also played my own media the kindle fire handles mp3 aac and ogg music including album art for video it plays h.264 and mpeg4 only at resolutions up to 1080p there s no bluetooth stereo support hdmi out or way to connect the kindle to a tv amazon would rather you play its cloud content through an amazon-enabled set-top box like a tivo i got 4 hours 55 minutes of continuous video playback on the kindle fire that s longer than our favorite small honeycomb

which of these closely matched products is best for you see kindle fire vs nook tablet how to choose since the publication of this review amazon has released several free over-the-air software updates for the kindle fire including os version 6.2.2 released january 18 2012 these updates provide some general enhancements allow a degree of parental control improve the rendering speed display width and navigation performance of its web browser and allow you to selectively hide items in the home screen carousel we recommend installing these updates in the world of tablets there are great products and there are cheap products but very few great cheap products fortunately for those of you unwilling to shell out 500 for an apple ipad 2 and wary of buying a piece of junk amazon s 199 kindle fire tablet should be at the top of your wish list the kindle fire is not the best tablet i ve seen this year but i have to give credit to amazon for seeing something that no other manufacturer--not even apple--was able to grasp when you look at the gap between what tablets are capable of doing and what people actually use them for you ll find that most people just want to be entertained the kindle fire is here to entertain us and at 199 i suspect many will take amazon up on the offer if you need a tablet that can keep up with your jet-setting spreadsheet-editing video-chatting lifestyle i can point you to a few dozen better options for the rest of you read on design and features the kindle fire is a tablet with a 7-inch screen giving it a similar look and feel as the rim blackberry playbook or samsung galaxy tab 7 it runs a heavily modified version of google s operating system includes 8gb of internal memory and begins shipping to u.s customers on november 15 the kindle fire left uses a 7-inch screen that is roughly half the area of the apple ipad 2 i prefer the ipad s larger screen for web browsing reading magazines and watching videos but i also like the idea of saving 300 with it you can read e-books using amazon s popular kindle software download android apps and games using amazon s appstore purchase music using amazon s mp3 store and watch videos using amazon s video on-demand and download services the common thread here is that amazon s digital stores and services are all loaded and ready to go out of the box in fact there s no getting around them since they re baked into the home screen navigation on the bottom of the kindle fire you ll find a headphone jack a micro-usb port and a power button an included wall adapter charges the tablet using the micro-usb port many basic features are covered as well you can browse the web more on that below e-mail your friends read common document files including pdf word excel powerpoint and others view photos and listen to locally stored music files without any hiccups a common micro-usb connection on the bottom of the kindle fire allows you to easily connect to any mac or pc to transfer any content you want to take along while you re down there you ll find a headphone jack and the kindle s power button flip it over and you ll find two adequately powered speakers sitting on the top edge you ll have a tough time not covering up the speakers with your hand while watching videos in landscape view but it s not impossible software and services for software you re really limited to the amazon way of doing things you can download third-party apps but they come by way of amazon s app store the underlying software may be google s but key android features such as maps gmail calendar navigation and the google app market are all absent the unspoken deal you re making with amazon here is that in exchange for an inexpensive tablet you re agreeing to get your apps your games your books your music and your videos through its services it s a benevolent dictatorship though and to be fair apple runs its tablet the same way just like the ipad amazon seems open to the idea that offering competing services such as netflix hulu plus rhapsody pandora comixology and others to see what apps are available just head over to amazon s online app store and poke around the other good news is that amazon s services don t suck their music store is absolutely on par with itunes in terms of selection and their prices are cheaper in most cases amazon s e-book store is arguably the most popular in the industry and put the kindle brand on the map their freshly unveiled newsstand offers over 400 full-color magazines and newspapers at launch which can be purchased as single issues or subscriptions an overview of their selection can be seen on amazon s site and then there s video in my view this is where amazon s tablet really shines if you re just looking for an e-reader a low-cost e-ink reader is arguably a better value than the kindle fire if you just want apps and games on a 199 device an ipod touch will deliver more content but when it comes to watching video the kindle fire s combination of 7-inch ips screen and a one-click library of tv shows and movies not to mention flash-based web content is an unmatched proposition under the browser s settings amazon includes the ability to force web pages to either a mobile view or desktop view which is handy if you abhor mobile-optimized sites or if you re willing to sacrifice beauty for faster page loads you ll also find a setting for disabling amazon s accelerated page-loading technology if you re creeped out by the idea of amazon s computers predicting your browsing habits they promise the collected data isn t linked to your account but you can never be too safe i suppose on that same note there s no private browsing mode on the kindle fire like the one found on both the ipad 2 and google s honeycomb browser i m also a little surprised to see that amazon hasn t included much in the way of parental controls on the kindle fire users are given a password option for the screen lock and a password lockout option for the wi-fi connection but there are no detailed controls for limiting playback of locally stored age-restricted material or mature game content apple has done an exceptional job implementing these sorts of controls on its ios products and it s the sort of thing that would make the kindle fire much easier to recommend for children and teens the kindle fire s video menu ties directly in with amazon s digital video store offering an impressive selection of movie rentals downloads and tv shows to seal the deal amazon includes one free month of all-you-can-stream instant videos including popular tv series such as lost and 24 as well as popular movies like eternal sunshine of the spotless mind and last of the mohicans if you re already enrolled in amazon s 79/year amazon prime program this free instant video content sticks around and you can enjoy other perks such as free two-day shipping and amazon s kindle lending library nonmembers can still pay for content a la carte tv shows are priced at 1.99 per episode movies can be rented for between 2.99 and 3.99 or purchased typically for around 14.99 free apps for netflix and hulu plus are also available if you want to venture beyond amazon s offerings amazon s cloud technology adds a key component to the kindle fire experience like apple amazon will back up any digital media you purchase e-books apps music and serve it back down to you at your convenience being able to have instant access to your archived media content also makes up somewhat for the limited storage on the device just 8gb in addition to archiving your purchased content amazon s included cloud drive service offers another 5gb of storage any additional content you want to access photos music documents etc. amazon s vast server farms are good for more than just storage a unique web browser called silk is included on the kindle fire it splits the work of loading web pages between the device and amazon s elastic compute cloud ec2 system the result in theory leads to faster page loads as well as some predictive loading of content and sites you access often no other tablet on the market has a feature like this--not even apple continue to next page 1 2 editors top

toy s bespoke cardboard packaging it looks nothing like a typical amazon shipping box and be greeted by a playful home screen that comes personalized with their very own name these lucky few will bask in early adopter bliss they will issue themselves hearty high-fives for having the foresight to purchase the year s hottest gadget sight unseen and then they will marvel at a device that really does bring something fresh and clever to the tablet space namely an insanely low price the fire is a fiendishly effective shopping portal in the guise of a 7-inch slate but everything i describe above accounts for just the first five minutes of kindle fire use the fire isn t a dud but its real-world performance and utility match neither the benchmarks of public expectation nor the standards set by the world s best tablets the fire s 7-inch 1024 600 screen is too small for many key tablet activities the fire s processor a 1ghz dual-core chip appears all but insufficient for fluid silky-smooth web browsing an area where i found performance to be preternaturally slow and unlike most of its tablet competitors the fire lacks a camera 3g data connectivity and a slot for removable storage as an assembly of physical components the fire lives at the bottom of the tablet food chain and this limits what the fire can actually do as a piece of mobile hardware but all those consumers who pre-ordered the fire knew this going in right hardware schmardware let s sell some content the business press has celebrated the 200 kindle fire as an ipad killer a loss-leading product that s been priced to lure away potential ipad customers with amazon making back all its money and then some by selling untold petabytes of content from its own digital storefront in effect amazon may not make margins on the tablet itself but the fire will catapult the company s digital sales sky-high and lob a nelson muntzian ha-hah directly in the face of apple but that s a business story and it s a story that may have left some consumers confused the press has lauded amazon s strategy to goose digital sales but the accolades shouldn t have been interpreted as explicit endorsements of well a device that people might actually want to use in the real world i ve been testing a kindle fire loaner unit for the last five days and i m impressed by how it elegantly repackages and streamlines every phase of the familiar amazon purchasing experience indeed the fire is a fiendishly effective shopping portal in the guise of a 7-inch slate it s also a winning video playback device that uses netflix hulu plus and amazon s own digital storefront to deliver hundreds of thousands of movies and tv shows many of them free see also jeff bezos owns the web in more ways than you think kindle touch review and yes the fire is pretty good bargain for anyone who s only comfortable with cautious toe-dipping in our presently murky and expensive tablet waters at 200 the fire crosses an impulse-buy threshold albeit a steep one that apple s 500 entry-level ipad 2 can t even approach all these enticing features are topped off by a free one-month subscription to amazon prime the company s premium membership service prime provides free two-day shipping on all physical deliveries free access to some 13 000 streaming videos and free access to amazon s kindle owners lending library this library lets you borrow e-books from a selection of more than 5 000 titles including 100-plus current and former new york times bestsellers one e-book at a time and one borrow per month but with no pesky due dates in total prime alone would seem to justify a kindle fire purchase if not for the fact that the service is open to all amazon customers for just 79 a year this means one month of free amazon prime access is just a 6.58 value-add for anyone who buys the kindle fire all of which leads us back to what the fire can actually do as a day-in day-out mobile workhorse is it tablet that people will grab again and again for web browsing book and magazine reading casual gaming and more no it s not that kind of tablet pages 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 view all '),(449,'2012-10-30 12:30:08',6.6,94,' lt cdata

tablets may not have the brand cachet of the ipad or the kindle fire but the bookseller s done an impressive job of turning itself into a consumer electronics company while it s done so though the company s had trouble keeping pace with its competitors on another front content the nook tablet like the nook color before it is a solid piece of hardware but with an app store and a content ecosystem that paled next to its competitors its appeal was somewhat limited now barnes amp noble s back with the nook hd and not only has the company improved the hardware it s plugged the holes in its content universe the tablet connects to the new nook video store and integrates with ultraviolet so you get digital copies of movies you purchase in walmart and elsewhere it also has a new version of the nook os a bunch of new features and plenty of magazines books and catalogs to read it all comes in an 11-ounce reading-friendly body with a display that barnes amp noble said over and over is better than any other 7-inch tablet the nook hd starts at 199 for 8gb of internal storage and for 229 you ll get 16gb it s a compelling proposition but it comes at a dangerous time the 7-inch tablet market is getting good fast can the nook hd hang with the nexus 7 the kindle fire hd and the new ipad mini let s find out hardware hardware / design equal parts tablet and e-reader barnes amp noble nook hd pictures previous next view full gallery previous next jdocument.readyfunction j gallery3335439 .gallery amazon s tablets are increasingly less about reading and more about watching movies browsing the web and generally being like the ipad the nook hd on the other hand is still a reading device through and through that s most obviously borne out in the wide plastic bezels on either side of the screen they make the nook hd a little wider than it needs to be but it s also eminently easy to hold in one hand and unlike the ipad mini the nook hd s bezels let you keep your thumbs from blocking any of the screen despite the plastic edges the nook hd doesn t feel cheap or chintzy at all the soft-touch rubber back feels great in your hand and the seam between the two pieces is small enough that the device almost feels unibody the sloped edges move toward the back curved to neatly match the way your palm folds around it great care was clearly taken to make sure you can hold this tablet in either hand at 11mm thick and 11.1 ounces it s a little large for a device its size but there s so much room to hold onto the nook hd that it s still easy to wield the nook hd comes in two colors smoke and snow also known as gray and white my review unit is gray though i actually prefer the white model a bit more there are camouflaged volume buttons on the right side a power button on the left side and a 3.5mm headphone jack on top on the bottom you ll find the large proprietary charging port that too many manufacturers believe is a good idea there s zero decoration on the front of the nook hd except for the n-shaped home button and on the back there s a nook logo and an indented n there s not even a blemish for the camera lens because there s no camera on the nook hd a front-facing camera might be a good thing to have once in a while but i can t say i missed it it s a minimalist simple device but it still manages to be unique in a way few other tablets are other tablets like say the kindle fire hd display / speakers display and speakers the display got lots of attention from barnes amp noble at the expense of other features when barnes amp noble first introduced the nook hd company reps spent a long time extolling the virtues of its 7-inch 1440 x 900 display all the boasting was merited this is the best screen i ve seen on a 7-inch tablet and it s not even close the 243ppi pixel density means you won t see any individual pixels unless you look really hard and since it s laminated to the glass it almost feels like things on the screen are popping out at you what impresses me most though is the color reproduction blacks are deep to the point that they appear to be not lit at all making dark scenes in sherlock holmes all the more ominous from skin tones to vivid colors everything is accurate crisp and clean that s great for reading black text on white backgrounds and it s great for watching movies it s just a fantastic display but as good as the screen is that s how bad the nook hd s speakers are there are two speakers on the bottom of the tablet as you hold it in landscape they re so astonishingly quiet that i spent a half-hour looking in settings to see if i had turned something down by accident i hadn t even in a dead-quiet room dialog is virtually inaudible and music is hard to hear even at full volume the sound that s coming out is clear and never distorts but that s not exactly impressive when they re hardly outputting any sound at all a good set of headphones or a bluetooth speaker is a must-have companion to this device software / performance software and performance there s a laundry list of smart ideas and cool features baked into the latest version of barnes amp noble s nook operating system it s based on android 4.0 but it s totally unrecognizable as android like amazon with the kindle fire barnes amp noble went completely its own direction the new version not only patches holes from older models tabbed browsing is finally here for instance but it includes many new things as well it s really easy to set up multiple accounts on the nook hd for instance and to control access to content you can quickly make a book or app available to your kid s account without letting them buy any more or give them access to certain files but not others there s a carousel on the home screen with your recently accessed files apps and books it s similar to the kindle fire hd but it s just a feature of the ui instead of dominating the experience out of the box the nook hd comes with a subtly textured gray wallpaper there are a number of other options but i didn t find one i liked as much as the default it s simple and classy which really describes the whole nook aesthetic book covers and app icons make up most of the visual pop in the ui which tries its best to show off the stuff you might want to read or watch for the most part i really like the look which is intuitive and never in your face there are definitely issues the drop shadows on app icons are absolutely out of control for instance but barnes amp noble definitely took android in a toned-down reading-friendly direction i also really like nook today which gives you a great way to find new things to read and watch at any given time barnes amp noble has a wealth of purchase data thanks to its retail presence and its recommendations on the nook hd are really good and speaking of content there s a lot more of it the new nook video store lets you rent or buy a huge number of movies and tv shows and while the library s not as big as its competitors it does seem to have the biggest and newest movies and shows same goes for apps i d much rather have access to the whole google play store than barnes amp noble s curated ecosystem but nine times out of ten the app i was looking for was available in the nook s shop good things done poorly the reading experience at least is rock solid on paper based on features and specs alone this is one of the best tablets out there but the nook hd just doesn t work well at all almost every time you touch anything the response is riddled with lags stutters and crashes apps take a few seconds to load each and every time whether you re scrolling in the browser or just in your library it s stuttery and lags behind your finger playing ski safari the best game in the world was a jittery mess with frame rates dipping so low at points i could barely see what was happening when you open the browser you can actually tell the order in which the elements of the app load it s that slow there s a persistent icon in the bottom right corner that pops up your most recently accessed content but it takes three seconds to load every time it s only the fastest way to move around because going home and re-launching an app takes even longer when you switch accounts it pops up the previous account for a half-second before loading the new account that s not exactly private too often when i first started using the nook hd i d repeat an action thinking it hadn t registered only to have the tablet catch up and do the same thing twice so i quickly learned to do something wait two seconds and then do it again if nothing happened which is also frustratingly common i saw too many things half-loaded too many empty icons populating and too many problems for the nook hd s performance to be acceptable when the company first introduced the device i was taken aback by performance issues but was promised that they were simply a symptom of unfinished software it may be final now but it s still not finished not by a long shot fortunately there are a few things that do feel optimized and polished turning a page in a book is fluid and smooth and the reading experience is actually pretty great the reading experience is crazy customizable you can choose from six different color schemes eight font sizes and plenty of fonts margin sizes and line heights page turns are reliable and fast and along with the great display it really does make for a good reading experience also once it finally loads the carousel on the home screen scrolls around nicely and is a handy way to navigate a lot of content but honestly those are the only two things i can think of that were consistently as fast and reliable as i expected on the bright side battery life is excellent on a hurricane-induced day indoors i was able to use netflix to stream true grit the karate kid free willy and then most of free willy again all before the battery died that s six hours eight minutes of constant video streaming mostly in hd except for when the storm made my internet drop a bit in more normal use expect the nook hd to be like most tablets you ll charge it every three days or so and you ll rarely even think about its power levels update barnes amp noble updated the nook hd s software after this review was published and the company promised to fix most of the issues i found with my review unit the update did improve the overall performance but only slightly there s still a lot of lag as you open and close apps and scrolling is still riddled with stutters the resume function in video now works as advertised but you ll still need headphones because audio is as anemic as always the latest version is definitely an improvement but it s not enough to make me recommend the nook

issues terrible speakers app selection feels unnecessarily curated a beautiful mess barnes amp noble gets full marks for its ability to design a great product i m a fan of almost everything the company tried to do with the nook hd i only wish the execution were equal to the conception from the slow ui to the poor gaming performance this just isn t a fun device to use i like reading on the nook hd and i like watching movies most of that is due to the display which really is best-in-class almost everything else feels like a chore like i m beta-testing a device that will someday have its kinks ironed out i hope that day comes for the nook hd when it feels like a final product but for right now it s not on the same level as the other good 7-inch tablets like the kindle fire hd or the nexus 7 i want all of the features the nook hd offers but i d rather just have a tablet that works the breakdown more times than not the verge score is based on the average of the subscores below

high-resolution display that pcmag calls distinctly better than the screens on the nook s main competitors amazon s kindle fire hd and the asus nexus 7 the viewing angle is the best i ve seen on a tablet so far i thought i loved the kindle fire hd s screen this one is better that display and the nook s software make it a very good e-reader especially for colorful content like magazines comics and children s books engadget points out that more visual texts are where the nook hd really shines magazines like details really do look stunning on the hd display the hd display is also great for movies though time warns if you plan to watch much video i d confirm that barnes amp noble s movie and tv show selection is as impressive as the company claims before opting for the nook hd over the kindle fire hd the nook hd also offers multiple accounts is thinner and lighter than the fire hd and an sd card slot for extra storage while we still think the nexus 7 is a better option for most users according to time anyone who s got 199 to spend on a tablet should give this nook a look '),(451,'2012-10-30 00:00:00',7.5,94,' slide 2 slide 3 slide 4 slide 5 slide 6 slide 7 slide 8 slide 9

days comparing the nook hd to the top 7-inch tablets available and if there s anything i ve learned in that time it s this the devil s in the details from a cursory glance the average consumer might have a difficult time distinguishing one black gray or white slate from the next but it s the little things that set them apart stuff like weight corner design bezel width and texture are small things that play a big part in comfort and feel the nook hd comes in both smoke medium gray and snow kind of like ivory and has a soft rubberized back with a volume rocker on the top-right edge and a power/sleep button opposite it on the left on the bottom edge are a custom 30-pin charging connector and a microsd card slot covered with a door the tablet includes a 30-pin to usb cable that plugs into the included ac adapter dual speakers sit on the lower back and the top edge of the tablet seat a headphone jack and microphone the home button and the home screen these are your options credit james martin/cnet in middle of the bottom border right above the bezel is the hardware home button last seen on the nook tablet like on the ipad the home button is a great just press this if things get confusing solution for the ever-evolving tablet interface unfortunately there s no built-in camera no ambient light sensor no micro-usb and no hdmi port the nook hd s corners are smoothly rounded and at only 0.69 pound it s the lightest 7-inch tablet available and feels perfectly comfortable when held the device is as thick depth-wise as the nexus 7 and a bit thicker than the fire hd and though it s wider than the nexus 7 it s noticeably narrower than the almost-too-wide fire hd held vertically the side bezel s width just about matches the nexus 7 however you get a little extra space

or along the right bezel yields a visible screen warping effect on the tablet screen now screen warping occurs to some extent on nearly every tablet however if you re just holding the nook hd while reading a book or watching a movie you ll likely have no cause to apply enough pressure to your nook hd for this to be a problem the interface the nook hd s operating system uses ice cream sandwich as its base with a custom-designed skin that feels like an evolution of the original nook tablet s os the home screen sports a light gray slightly textured aesthetic that permeates through all native apps and menus the home screen shows library apps web email and shop options near the bottom with a global search bar underneath directly above is a space to organize your content shortcut icons and near the top of the screen sits your content carousel once in your library you ll have access to every piece of content available to you credit james martin/cnet in the top-right edge of the screen is your nook today which shows the current weather as well as book and movie recommendations based on recent additions to your library also if the opt-out-of-ads kerfuffle for the fire hd turned you off you ll be pleased to know that barnes amp noble has no such ads on its tablets settings can be accessed by tapping the gear at the very top right of the screen and includes options too many to name if you ve ever used a tablet before however there s nothing included in the settings that will surprise you the default software keyboard thankfully includes a tab but typing didn t feel as as accurate as it does on the nexus 7 nook profiles allow multiple users to use a single tablet while keeping each person s content their own credit james martin/cnet nook profiles can be accessed from the upper left-hand corner and allows users to set up multiple profiles on a single tablet with a simple tap of the profile photo at the top of the screen you can choose to switch to a new profile almost instantly once in the new profile that user s content and only that user s content will be displayed and accessible lock-screen switching is also possible both adult and child profiles can be accessed and passwords can be added to adult profiles ensuring that not just anyone can access your content nook profiles are simple to implement and feel secure and useful likely appealing to families on a budget overall the interface is much cleaner and intuitive than the nook tablet s however i still have a few problems with navigation as much as i like the home button i feel the interface relies on it a bit too much if looking at a magazine for example there s no built-in navigation to view all magazines and you re forced to use the home button and then navigate to another piece of content if you want to switch not a huge deal but it s annoying in the moment content ecosystem not to be outdone by amazon and its instant video service barnes amp noble now has its own for the nook hd and nook hd nook video offers both standard-definition and high-definition versions of video content for purchase or rental with hd video streaming supported as well unfortunately its current library comes nowhere near amazon s or google s in terms of selection if you re looking for lots of recent popular movies you won t find them here well you ll find some like the avengers brave and prometheus but total recall the hunger games and the expendables 2 are nowhere to be found since its launch a few weeks back the selection of movies available on the service has definitely improved with new popular titles being added every week there s still lots of room to fill things out however tv shows have also begun to fill out albiet at a seemingly slower rate barnes amp nobles says it hopes to continue adding more media as the end of the year approaches among the most popular 7-inch tablets the nook hd is the only device that includes a microsd card for storage expansion credit james martin/cnet while its video media content selection is currently disappointing its video interface could use some improvements when downloading a movie on the fire hd you can start watching it just a few seconds after the download begins you can start previewing early on the nook hd but you have to wait until the download is at least 20 percent completed other useful fire features like the skip-back 10 seconds button and x-ray for movies are options barnes amp noble currently can t match if you have an ultraviolet account any movies added to your digital ultraviolet library will show up in your nook hd library as well a netflix app is also available but there are no plans to bring hbo go just yet the tablet supports mp4 3gp webm avi video files but try as i might mkv files would not play hey i hear the nook hd does pretty well with books credit james martin/cnet books are of course the nook hd s strong suit and thanks to its high-resolution screen text in books is crisp and clean i also appreciate to option to change the line spacing while reading something not offered in the fire hd s settings however fire hd reading options like x-ray the percentage read counter and immersion

that s not just about the tight 1 440-by-900-pixel resolution which makes text sharper than on the other tablets the screen is also noticeably less reflective and has deeper blacks than either the kindle s or nexus s screens which makes reading easier the viewing angle is the best i ve seen on a tablet so far i thought i loved the kindle fire hd s screen this one is better on the bottom is a microsd card slot which takes up to 64gb cards along with an annoying proprietary charging port barnes amp noble says it ll have an hdmi-out cable for the nook hd in the future but that still compares poorly to the kindle fire hd s more standard micro hdmi port there s also a relatively quiet speaker the headphone jack is on the top the microsd card lets the nook hd store a lot more data than competing 199 tablets but its utility is limited by what you can play the nook hd plays mp3 and aac music files and mpeg4 and h.264 videos the tablet can also view unprotected epub-formatted ebooks cbz-formatted comics pdfs and microsoft office documents stored on a memory card but they re buried two levels down in the library screen divx and xvid videos are out and you can t sideload apps although the epub and cbz support is welcome there are no alternative video players or book readers in the nook store to display content not downloaded from barnes amp noble so support for third-party formats falls well short of the kindle fire hd and nexus 7 battery life at 5 hours 16 minutes of video playback with the screen at full brightness was noticeably shorter than the 7 hours i got on the kindle fire hd performance and appsthe nook hd runs a ti omap 4470 processor at 1.3ghz which is considerably faster than the processor in the kindle fire hd i couldn t run our benchmarks on the tablet but page turns were smoother applications loaded more quickly and there were fewer delays as page thumbnails loaded than i saw on the kindle fire hd casual games like bad piggies and fruit ninja played smoothly this is a wi-fi-only tablet with 2.4ghz wi-fi but not the 5ghz support featured on the kindle fire hd that s important because the nook s hd video files are often quite large so they d have benefitted from 5ghz wi-fi s faster download times like the kindle fire hd the nook hd runs a heavily altered basically unrecognizable version of android 4.0 it s even simpler and more pared-down than the kindle s interface when you turn on your nook you get the option to choose between your user profiles i ll explain those below then you see a screen with a configurable shelf of your favorite apps and five options library apps web email and shop that s it hitting a button at the top of the screen pops down your nook today which gives you the weather and some shopping suggestions based on

convention made the carrier s android phones virtually synonymous with their operating system but now i hear people every day saying oh is that the new galaxy or i don t really want an iphone i think i m going to get a galaxy thanks to its high quality and wide availability not to mention samsung s sheer brute-forcing marketing effort the galaxy s iii became the face of the android universe it has sold tens of millions of units and helped android take huge marketshare away from the iphone now samsung s back with that device s successor the galaxy s4 the new handset changes little from the gs iii but it adds a lot a bigger screen and a laundry list of software tweaks and features it s a variation on a theme a safe tweak to a strategy that s worked impossibly well for samsung but the landscape has changed since the galaxy s iii came out and good cameras big and beautiful screens and fast performance now come virtually standard the galaxy s4 comes into a fiercely competitive market with great phones on all sides and a particularly strong showing from the htc one is it enough of an improvement to keep samsung atop the android heap i ve had one for a week or so and i have a few

primary competitors are the iphone 5 and the htc one and from a pure design perspective that should make samsung very very nervous where apple and htc have both made beautiful well-made high-quality phones the gs4 has samsung back in the land of cheap plasticky handsets it looks for all the world like the galaxy s iii despite having a bigger screen and more horsepower at 7.9mm and 4.6 ounces it s actually imperceptibly thinner and lighter than the s iii but copying the s iii wasn t a good idea i don t like holding this phone and i can t overstate how much that informs the experience of using it it makes an awful first impression slippery and slimy and simply unpleasant in your hand my white review unit is completely smooth and glossy with a subtle checkered pattern that looks textured but is neither grippy nor textured anywhere on its body even the silver band around the sides which is obviously supposed to look like metal is plastic everyone i showed the gs4 to frowned and wrinkled their nose as if it smelled bad before rubbing their fingers on the back of the phone and then handing it back to me that s the opposite of the standard reaction to htc s one which everyone wants to ogle and hold that s going to be a huge problem for samsung because the gs4 and one are likely to be next to each other on store shelves and at least on first impression there s absolutely no contest between the two it s a shame too because samsung didn t have to do it this way the company made tradeoffs for a removable battery and a slightly thinner body but i m not sure those are features worth sacrificing so much for in 2013 it s not all bad the gs4 is thin and light and feels durable despite its cheap materials it s also an improvement over the s iii thanks to slightly flatter edges and shrunken bezels the port layout is smart power button on the right volume on the left headphone jack up top and micro usb on the bottom with the sim card microsd slot and battery accessible when you peel off the removable back i m thrilled the gs4 has a physical home button with capacitive back and menu keys on either side it s very comfortable for such a large phone but i can t get over the gross feeling i get holding it samsung s proven repeatedly that people don t care about build quality or at least will overlook it in favor of features and performance but the landscape s different now the htc one is a powerful feature-rich device that is also beautiful and classy while samsung s handset feels like an overpowered children s toy samsung s feature list has to be awfully long to overcome that and it is but i ll get there can we finally decide design matters display in living color it may not be perfectly accurate but it looks good through my entire time with the gs4 i kept imagining walking through a store and trying to pick a phone before even considering how samsung can beat htc i wondered how such an apparently evolutionary change would convince users to upgrade from the s iii or to spring for the newer and more expensive model when the gsiii is still a solid choice the answer s simple and luckily for samsung it s also immediately obvious it s the screen the gs4 s 5-inch 1920 x 1080 display is big beautiful and seriously eye-catching the latter is partially a bad thing the s4 uses a super amoled panel like many of samsung s phones and like many of samsung s phones it displays overly contrasted and vibrant colors those colors may not be accurate reds and oranges absolutely explode off the screen whether they should or not but they certainly catch your eye and with a ridiculous 441 pixels per inch even the pentile display matrix i usually loathe causes no problems the glass is rigid and responsive to touch and works even if you have gloves on which i shouldn t have needed to test in april in new york city and yet here we are for some reason samsung has always had trouble with screen brightness settings the gs4 can never seem to decide how bright its screen should be changing suddenly and drastically often and without warning i turned automatic brightness off very quickly i tried to pick my favorite between the one s display and the gs4 s and wound up going back and forth a dozen times before giving up both are incredibly high-res bright and crystal clear the one is slightly more accurate but i still periodically forget my nitpicking and get lost in the gs4 s vibrant colors you really can t lose and that s pretty great the lone speaker on the galaxy s4 resides on its backside in that wonderfully unconsidered spot where audio is both muffled by your hand and blasting directly away from your ears once again htc broke the curve by offering two big powerful speakers pointed straight at your face but the one aside the gs4 offers surprisingly loud sound from rear-facing grille it s not very rich and is very compressed but it s loud loud is good camera the camera instagram deserves while htc is trying to convince buyers that megapixels don t matter and that its so-called ultrapixels are better anyway samsung went the opposite direction i don t know if all the pixels the galaxy s4 s 13-megapixel sensor are the reason or if i should credit samsung s fast processor or the clear attention paid to its software but the upshot is that the gs4 s camera is the best android camera i ve ever used by a considerable margin and in most cases it s every bit as good as the iphone 5 s camera however the one and the nokia lumia 920 do considerably better than the gs4 in poor lighting when it s dark the gs4 takes the same soft noisy pictures as any other smartphone camera but without the incredible brightness capabilities of the one there are pictures you ll get with the one or the 920 that the gs4 just can t capture the gs4 s autofocus stumbles in low light too i learned quickly to take three shots at night in order to get one that was properly focused it s actually samsung s experience with dedicated cameras that make shooting photos with the gs4 so nice the company borrowed a lot of the gs4 s camera software from the galaxy camera a concept car of sorts that clearly informed its ability to build a great cameraphone the interface is much improved over the s iii from the scrolling mode dial to the one-press capture of either stills or video it s also simple and fast two things many cellphone cameras are not samsung galaxy s4 sample images previous next view full gallery previous next jdocument.readyfunction j gallery4023521 .gallery the gs4 s greatest photographic achievement though is that it manages to be simple and fast while simultaneously offering the largest most impressive feature set of any smartphone camera i ve ever used if you re just turning the phone to auto and firing pictures you re missing out instead you should try turning it to eraser mode which detects moving objects in your photo like the stranger that always walks by right as you take the shot and automatically removes them or scroll up to drama shot which takes a series of pictures as a subject moves and then shows a whole leap or the soccer ball s whole flight path in one automatically-overlaid photo animated photo lets you take a few seconds of video then choose with your finger whether a part of the frame is still or in motion you can actually create and share animated gifs without ever leaving the camera app some of the more advanced features require some staging and drama shot sometimes takes a couple of tries but they re all pretty cool all except for dual camera which despite samsung s heavy promotion remains a mystery to me the pitch is simple enough you take a picture with both front and rear cameras simultaneously and overlay one on the other so the person taking the picture appears in the picture as well it s a neat idea in theory but in practice left me just superimposing giant versions of my head onto random buildings inside weird postage-stamp borders or within a heart it s a fun silly way to take an i m in new york selfie without turning the camera on yourself and maybe that s enough but it s still a little odd that samsung is putting so much marketing muscle behind such a niche feature there are a lot of trees in this forest some of them less than perfect but taken as a whole the galaxy s4 s camera is a triumph if it supplants the many terrible android cameras posting to my instagram feed we ll all be better off software what comes after the kitchen sink speaking of forests with lots of trees the gs4 may run android 4.2 but samsung has heaped so many features on top of google s operating system that it almost feels like something entirely different normally i m conditioned to believe stock android is better than any manufacturer skin but samsung overhauls the software so completely that i m less annoyed than i would be with a company like motorola or lg where the changes are typically a combination of aesthetic problematic and pointless some of samsung s added features are all three but many are downright useful to start the gs4 keeps all the features samsung has debuted on various note models and the galaxy s iii samsung pioneered the radio and connectivity toggles in the notification windowshade and the gs4 offers access more and more settings there including a brightness slider samsung s big clock-and-weather widget comes on the home screen by default and the general touchwiz look and feel remains intact the green-on-blue-on-gray scheme is growing on me but samsung s hideous calendar app never will likewise many of the phone menus and screens look cartoonishly terrible with huge icons and ugly images what touchwiz mostly offers is options with a bit of effort the gs4 can look and feel almost any way you choose you can hide or rearrange apps in the app drawer pick and choose quick-launch apps for the lock screen change the order of settings and toggles and much much more there s even an easy mode on the gs4 which turns your phone into something like john s phone it presents a simple dialer shortcuts to a few common apps huge icons for everything and hides almost everything else samsung probably should ve taken this as a sign because if your phone needs easy mode you re probably doing something wrong but it does at least do a nice job simplifying everything the gs4 has going on the galaxy s4 has a lot going on maybe too much and boy is there a lot going on there are now 18 yes eighteen toggles in the notification pulldown which you can see by pressing a new button at the top right it opens up a command center of sorts which lets you turn off everything from wi-fi and bluetooth to some of the wilder eye-tracking features i kind of wish there were a medium mode that would take away all the minority report stuff and just leave a more normal android phone i ll never forget samsung s launch event for the gs4 a bizarre spectacle at radio city music hall where actors went through feature after feature explaining how they work together to make the gs4 your life companion some of samsung s additions fit this bill a little more closely than others s health is the best example of an actual life companion it s a fitbit- or fuelband-style app that tracks your steps calories sleep and diet offering you a way to get fit or in my case just provide more data about my pathetically sedentary lifestyle it s handy to have built right into your phone and the app s pretty powerful thanks to the s4 s temperature and humidity sensors you can actually tell it how you feel and it ll figure out how you should adjust your surroundings to feel better s health is a great tool though it won t be as good as it could be until its companion accessories come out in a few months time my aforementioned sedentary lifestyle is also probably to blame for why i used watchon samsung s handy universal remote and search-based tv guide app far more than s health it s a great app offering quick and easy control over your whole home theater setup via the ir blaster on top of the gs4 plus the really clever peel-made search and recommendations interface across your cable box netflix blockbuster and other services more than anything it s just convenient i tend to have my phone in my hands while i watch tv anyway so switching to watchon to change the channel is light work there s a full-fledged suite of office products via the polaris suite though i can t say there s any way to make editing a powerpoint on your phone a pleasant experience there s also a built-in translator app i bet you can guess it s name plus a handy tool for scanning business cards and qr codes carriers in my case t-mobile also add some bloatware though samsung lets you hide most of the apps you don t want from the drawer yet again the gs4 is an incredibly malleable phone it just takes some work to get it the way you want you can even run two apps at once side-by-side with a system just like the note 8.0 s which works surprisingly well on a smaller screen because there are just so many pixels to play with i like the apps and services samsung adds to the android experience here but i m less enamored with all the ways samsung has reimagined how you ll want to actually interact with your cellphone these features were touted heavily on the gs iii despite the fact that i never once saw a regular person using s beam or allshare and the trend continues unabated with the s4 the hand waving software is more useful sometimes there s air view which approximates the galaxy note s ability to recognize when you re hovering over the screen with the s pen and unearth content without making you tap but requires only your finger it s handy for previewing an email without opening it or seeing stories in flipboard but not much else and it requires precision hovering a centimeter away from your target i wound up accidentally tapping on the screen half the time anyway air gestures has me completely torn it s really impressive letting you wave your hand over the phone to scroll up and down a webpage or flip through a gallery and it works reliably once you figure out your hand has to pass over the top of the phone where the ir sensor sits next to the earpiece i started using it while my hands were wet or if i had something in my hand sadly it doesn t work with pocket so i can t wave my coffee-filled hand over the phone to flip pages while riding the subway it s overly sensitive though and will often scroll back when you re just moving your hands around it also tended to jump as i was pointing something out or showing someone a photo which became a pain i wound up leaving both air view and air gestures on mostly just to show people how cool they are and because i love that i can wave at my phone to change songs the list goes on and on really with samsung offering features galore that you ll probably never use the story album app lets you create scrapbooks from your photos though there are plenty of third-party apps that do it better group play is like allshare on steroids you can have everyone listen to the same song at the same time play a game together or all look at a slideshow except everyone has to have a gs4 and jump through a bunch of hoops to get it all working of course there s also s beam and nfc plus a new security feature called knox that separates your personal information from your work data handy if you re bringing your gs4 to work mostly superfluous otherwise much of what samsung offers seems to be just for show designed to give sales clerks something to demo that makes the gs4 unique the best features get out of your way but too many are simply obtrusive i wound up using the gs4 like i would any other phone with most of the additional features off and as much as i d be thrilled to watch people waving at their phones on the subway i m not betting it catches on eye tracking and hand waving performance still on the bleeding edge samsung s galaxy s lineup has never wanted for power and neither does the galaxy s4 it s an impressively fast and powerful phone capable of handling anything i threw at it i could get it to drop frames in asphalt 7 or stutter ever so slightly when closing some apps but only by turning on and turning up every conceivable feature on the phone and even then its stumbles are rare used more normally once you ve disabled some of the more obnoxious software features it s virtually flawless i say virtually because the phone does trip up occasionally and only in surprising places like the gallery which sometimes freezes and crashes for no obvious reason samsung s software design is clearly to blame here and it s the most lasting reason i still dislike software skins they just create problems android doesn t otherwise have but otherwise the 1.9ghz qualcomm snapdragon 600 processor and 2gb of ram inside the s4 do every bit as well as you d expect bleeding-edge specs to do some international markets are getting galaxy s4s powered by samsung s own exynos processor which should be even more powerful the phone s going to be available on every carrier on the planet or at least samsung makes it feel that way it s coming to all four major us carriers plus a handful of smaller regional companies i tested a device with t-mobile and while this device supports the company s brand-new lte network and its new contract-free service plans i didn t have a chance to test it because well t-mobile s lte network only works in las vegas reception and data speeds were normal for t-mobile in new york city and i m looking forward to the bump when lte comes on in manhattan call quality was solid if unspectacular though i very much appreciated the extra volume button that makes the other person just astonishingly loud in your earpiece construction zones and sirens be damned you ll hear just fine my biggest frustration with the htc one has always been its battery it ll last a day but only with a bit of hand-holding if that s lower-middle class i d say the galaxy s4 is upper-middle class it lasts a full day almost no matter how i use it unless i stream hd netflix videos constantly in which case it dies in about five hours and will even get me to the morning if i forget to plug it in i rarely forget to plug my phone in every night and i don t mind needing to charge every night but i m so used to babysitting my iphone 5 all day or watching the one s meter hit red that not having to worry about the gs4 all day was pretty wonderful there s never a shortage of power from samsung wrap-up compare it samsung galaxy s4 8.0 verge score good stuff fast and powerful performance excellent camera gorgeous display lots of useful extra software bad stuff unpleasant cheap design sheer number of features can be overwhelming performance can suffer in odd places all the technology in the world can t cover up bad design i ended my htc one review by saying there were two android phones worth buying the one and the nexus 4 that number is now very clearly three but i had hoped against hope that samsung would emerge the undisputed winner the galaxy s4 is a very good phone in most respects it has a stellar camera and solid battery life blistering performance and an impressively useful complement of software features it s a technological achievement there s no question about that but part of what has me so excited about the smartphone market is that manufacturers are finally starting to step back from the relentless forward march of moore s law and spec races and seek quality in other places we ve seen it in laptops as companies like toshiba finally turn away from racing to the pricing bottom and begin to build truly excellent ultrabooks we re also seeing it in cellphones from the htc one and a small selection of other devices i don t need more cores more gigahertz or more software features that ostensibly help me use my phone more easily i need a phone that feels good in my hand looks good on my desk does everything i expect it to and gives me no reason to think it won t last the life of my two-year contract i bought an iphone 5 because last fall it was the only phone that fit that bill now there are several android options as well and they re good enough to make me want to switch back to google s os for now it s a choice every buyer will have to make you can have the far better-looking phone or you can have the slightly better-performing phone and you really can t choose wrong if the gs iii is any indication millions upon millions will choose the gs4 me i think design matters polish matters the galaxy s4 is fast and impressive but it s also noisy and complex the one is refined quiet comfortable beautiful and above all simply pleasant i love using that phone in a way i haven t experienced with anything since the iphone 5 that s why when my contract is up in june i ll probably be casting my lot with htc instead of samsung

kindle fire skate by with the bargain basement kindle or like goldilocks do you choose something in the middle the 100 kindle touch 139 without ads is that middle option while the touchscreen might feel like a new and fresh twist on the typical e-reader in reality the device is still riffing on amazon s original kindle with few tweaks to shake up that landmark experience it s still about reading books so what s new and how well does it work well that s what the review is for hardware hardware / design there s minimal perfection and there s bland kindle touch review previous next view full gallery previous next jdocument.readyfunction j gallery2324007 .gallery unlike some products the droid line for instance the kindle seems more staid design-wise with every generational refresh the last generation now known as the kindle keyboard still available for 99 a minimal razor-thin work of art might ve been amazon s peak there s nothing wrong with the kindle touch s looks they re just plain amazon might argue that this is all about making the device disappear while you read a book which certainly still holds true but there s minimal perfection and there s just bland.fun anecdote my dad is sort of gray blind which means among other things that he sometimes has trouble seeing gray cars i ve been in a couple near-accidents with him driving because he simply didn t see the car in the intersection if i threw the kindle touch at him he might not be able to catch it the device is coated with quality gray gunmetal plastic with the back s two-toned assembly reminiscent of the nexus one and it s easily unnoticed.the front of the device is a screen and solitary home button the button is just a series of ridges ostensibly meant to represent the list of books they pull up the screen is relatively deeply inset thanks to the optical touch recognition the same tech and the same inset is present on the nook simple touch and the surrounding gray bezel is just wide enough to be comfortably braced by a thumb when in the standard reading position the last kindle s screen was almost exactly flush with the surrounding plastic but to the kindle touch s credit there s such a thing as too thin and i actually find the slightly chunkier touch more comfortable to hold for long periods of time there s such a thing as too thin and i find the chunkier touch more comfortablethe only other button on the device is the lock / unlock / power button on the bottom which is situated right next to the headphone jack and usb plug while tapping a button to unlock the device seems totally reasonable the nook s slide-to-unlock is much more intuitive to me if i set the kindle down for a couple minutes and the screen locks it seems weird to have to go to the bottom of the device to be able to interact with my book again a combination of the home button and the touchscreen should suffice.as for the topic of battery life there is no topic of battery life it s not something i worry about with e-readers even with the 3g review unit i have amazon predicts a couple months with live ads being pushed and regular 3g use it might be closer to a week or two but either way it s not something to worry about.overall amazon is right the device does disappear in your hands i just wish that when i am paying attention it was a little more striking display display old fashioned books are still the readability champ with the hardware out of the way that just leaves you jeff bezos and the touchscreen to be clear this screen is the same e ink pearl screen that s been kicking around the e-reader space for a couple of years what s new at least as far as amazon is concerned is the touch sensing which is actually embedded in the bezel and works optically meaning you can use it with gloves on and there s nothing on top of the e ink to lessen readability a problem with early touch e-readers.amazon s picked up the same tricks that the nook simple touch uses to speed up page turns the technique is pretty simple instead of wiping the screen with each page turn the e ink beads only change the necessary pixels to show the new data there s a small amount of artifacting which gets cleared out every sixth page turn with an old fashioned wipe but the page turns are near immediate and much less jarring it s a great hack that makes e ink page turns finally completely tolerable i don t have any science to back this up but i d say the nook s page turns which recently benefited from a software update are just a hair faster also for whatever reason the nook s screen feels like it has slightly better contrast as well i don t know if this has to do with different e ink crops software optimizations or what either way it s not a major difference.speaking of contrast e ink still lacks it despite all the improvements to e ink over the years e ink still looks like dark green on light green and black ink on a printed white page is still vastly easier to read especially under indirect light the irony is that e ink really looks the best under direct sunlight or at least a nearby lamp while lcds are best kept out of the sun meanwhile old fashioned books aren t going anywhere yet as the readability champ no matter what the light is like maybe amazon s plan is to get you to buy a device for each lighting condition hey that s what whispersync s for right software software / touch now that there s a touchscreen i start to think of the kindle os as an os the kindle touch s most obvious addition is a touchscreen and it works flawlessly you can swipe or tap to turn pages and i had little problem doing either i usually switch back and forth between the actions but i d say tapping is my default amazon has split the screen into virtual sections with the top third or so meant for pulling up the menu the majority of the right for advancing to the next page and a small section of the left side for reversing directions swiping works from anywhere and if you hold down and drag you ll select text i never accidentally selected text when i meant to turn a page but the opposite happened numerous times there s a touchscreen keyboard which works great just like the nook s but excuse me if i m a little spoiled by the 21st century shouldn t this thing have auto-correction as-is the keyboard is only useful for jotting a sentence or two of misspelled notes while on my phone i frequently write a couple hundred words of notes in one sitting it s interesting how touchscreen interaction can make you perk up and pay attention to software when all i have is a d-pad i just want to scroll down my list of books choose one and get to reading now that there s a touchscreen i start to think of the kindle os as an os with features and menus and interesting possibilities most of which are lacking compared to a full-fledged version of android still amazon has added a couple new features to match that expectation x-ray my hands-down favorite thing about the kindle touch s software basically when you re in a book you can pull up the menu and select x-ray in the bottom right corner and the feature takes the proper nouns from your current page and shows you how much they repeat throughout the book in a totally glance-able graphical form for instance in the steve jobs biography john sculley and steve jobs are mentioned in the page i m on x-ray shows a bar for sculley with a blip at the beginning a strong appearance in the middle and then a couple blips near the end meanwhile jobs s bar is nearly black x-ray also works by chapter or as a view for the full book sorted by people or phrases basically an index cranked to 11 x-ray is basically an index cranked to 11games amazon has had some hard-to-find games available for the kindle for a while but with a touchscreen it becomes much more compelling there s number slide where you slide tiles around to get them in order with the black and white graphics i felt like i was back on my macintosh se and a much more entertaining game called every word reminiscent of popular flash games where you try to guess all the possible words from a set of letter tiles this isn t exactly infinity blade 2 but i had fun and there s a development kit coming that should hopefully open up the possibilities browser amazon has had a kindle browser labeled experimental for as long as human history i think it s time to take it out of the shed and promote it on the home screen especially with the touchscreen helping out interaction it s totally competent for reading the mobile versions of sites like this one and i d rather not have to jump through hoops to pull it up still none of this stuff has been pulled together in a cohesive os overall i think amazon s key software problem begins and ends with the homescreen in theory a simple list of books sounds nice and straightforward but the reality of this device is more complicated and the homescreen should reflect that i d like to at least see an option to turn on a nook-style homescreen which could offer a couple website favorites the recent books i ve been reading with covers and maybe even some purchase suggestions from amazon s vaunted recommendation engine speaking of recommendations i should mention the other major tweak with the software special offers if you want to save 39 the kindle touch is available with ads in reality it s not that obtrusive the lock screen instead of showing a famous author or your jpeg of choice shows an ad the same ad is represented in a low-profile bar at the bottom of the home screen what sorts of ads you get depends on a few factors if you live in a city with amazonlocal you might see groupon-style ads sometimes amazon has deals on books or other products in its store and sometimes plain-old ads pop up did you know there was a new twilight movie coming out now you do thanks to my kindle s lock screen now chris ziegler reviewed the new kindle and he likes the ads enough to opt-in i m not so crazy about them however there s something really personal to me about reading books and it really bugs me having an ad hover next to that experience i don t like the ad-supported versions of spotify or pandora for similar reasons the other problem is that if you just have the device out and about you never know what ad it s going to show i felt like flipping the device over on its face the other day due to a local pilates ad complete with awkward pilates stock photo that cropped up while i was at a coffee shop it s almost like i m not only being advertised to but that i m becoming an ad purveyor myself the good news is that you can always pay amazon to get rid of the ads so there s no harm in going for the cheap version and upgrading when you scrape together the cash ecosystem ecosystem i know there are several paragraphs above this one but for me this is where the decision is made in fact this is where my decision was made before i even got this device to review bias i loved the nook but i m invested in amazon s ecosystem hundreds of dollars invested with both e-books and audible books i might be near the 1 000 mark in audible alone if you go by msrp sure i can always listen to my audio books on my phone and just buy new books on the nook but let s not kid ourselves the kindle devices make my prior investment even more valuable and for me there s little alternative in the dedicated reader space plus amazon s whispersync puts the competition to shame when it comes to page place and notes sync if you re just getting started with e-books the in-store integration of the nook is compelling and the epub support is a big win for some but amazon has plenty to offer there with a huge library and a commitment to aggressive pricing the good news is that this is really a mature market now both amazon and b amp n offer over one million titles in their libraries and between library lending friend-to-friend lending public domain books and the sheer inevitability of e-books-as-the-future you ll be well served by a number of products on the market you ll just probably be best served by amazon amazon s whispersync puts the competition to shame wrap-up compare it amazon kindle touch 7.8 verge score write review good stuff great price touchscreen kindle ecosystem bad stuff boring design last-gen software ads pretty soon jeff bezos will show up at my house and pay me to take a kindle overall i really like the kindle touch hardware-wise i found the nook touch more responsive and more comfortable to hold and software-wise i found the nook touch more intuitive and mature outside of the kindle s amazing new x-ray but if i needed a touchscreen e ink reader right this second i d get the kindle in a heartbeat home is where the ecosystem is after all and there are zero dealbreakers here just slight preferences still do i really need a touchscreen e ink reader that s the bigger question between the nook tablet and the kindle fire there are two great cheap tablets available which do a lot more than just books plus with bigger and better phone displays at every turn e ink is started to look seriously dated it might be worth waiting for another generation of e ink to up the resolution and improve contrast and response even further but i might just have to admit to myself that e ink will probably never read as well as a real book or interact as well as an lcd although if you ve ever tried to read on an lcd in sunlight e ink will be an absolute godsend more likely jeff bezos will show up at my house and pay me to take a kindle and i ll join the e ink

still a bit clunky and it s not quite as small or comfortable to hold as the nook -- or even its lower-end sibling the kindle 4 still it s much easier to type with the kindle touch s touchscreen than

the text-based e-reader isn t ready for the dustbin of history quite yet the amazon kindle was supposed to be slaughtered by the advent of the multi-use touchscreen tablet and next to today s shiny glass slates the original kindle now four years old looks as antiquated as oh the first ipod but like the ipod the kindle sparked a revolution feeding a hunger few of us knew we had as such it has remained miraculously resilient and amazingly relevant kindle touch wi-fi-only with ads 100 wi-fi-only no ads 140 wi-fi/3g with ads 150 wi-fi/3g no ads 190 the new amazon kindle touch resembles the original kindle in function only it now has a touchscreen gone finally is the keyboard which seemed out out of place even on the first model though in the pre-tablet era it presciently provided the owner with a way to make a brief pit stop dashing off a mail or checking out a link gone as well are the page-turning buttons as users even infants assume and insist the screen be the sole interface the kindle is the last of the three major e-readers to switch to touchscreens kobo was first followed by the barnes amp noble nook but this is not a space where being first matters it s the other stuff the subtle enhancements that solve little problems and the impressive ecosystem of content you use to fill it that elevates a device these are the things that create a critical mass and these are the reasons why you should consider an amazon touch instead of a touchscreen nook or a touchscreen kobo let s start with the biggest of the little things the lack of page-turning buttons kobo eschews them and uses each edge of the page to go forward or back but two hands really are required for this nook uses two configurable buttons on the each edge of frame so that you can also advance and retreat one-handed but isn t this about being a touch device the kindle touch re-maps the e-ink page so that touching a thin one-inch strip of the screen on the extreme left serves up the previous page touching any part of the rest of the screen from the edge of that first inch all the way over to the right edge of the screen goes to the next page if you re holding the kindle with your left hand it s an easy stretch of the thumb see also jeff bezos owns the web in more ways than you think review amazon s new kindle fire tablet yes we all switch hands and going back a page while holding it right-handed becomes more complicated but we go forward a page much more often than we go back a page so going right-handed as your resting mode means this is a giant leap forward and it s not hard to imagine a next small step a software upgrade making left/right implementation an on-the-fly user option there s a thin strip at the very top of the screen which brings up a pop-up menu within that menu is another differentiating feature amazon s x-ray service when you load up a book some books not all additional data about proper-noun-type references like people places and events are loaded as well all this data is held invisibly in the background inside a small pre-loaded file you can call up that info at any time while reading by touching the screen so if you re reading walter isaacson s

shades of gray aside from the touch capability fonts appear as crisp as they do on the non-touch version they re slightly lighter on the kindle touch 3g but you d only notice it with the two devices side by side i think i prefer the touch actually you get three fonts eight text sizes and three choices each for line and word spacing i d like to see more fonts though both the barnes amp noble nook touch and the sony reader wi-fi 149 3.5 stars have larger nicer font selections as with the base kindle page turns are quick the kindle touch 3g only does full page refreshes every six page turns the rest of the time it employs a caching scheme to fade out the letters and fade in new ones while reading a book on the kindle touch 3g you don t need to swipe pages instead you can just tap the surface of the touch screen which i found intuitive most of the screen acts as a next page button with the left edge acting as a previous page button this lets you use the device with a single hand if you tap the area near the top you ll bring up the menu and toolbar here you can view your library organize your ebooks choose an ebook to read or tap and hold a book for options the single home button at the bottom of the kindle which looks like a speaker grille in photos but is actually a hardware button returns you to the home screen at any point user interface typing and x-raylike other kindles the home screen just shows you a text-based list of what s on your ereader sorted by when you last read each item the nook does it better with an attractive presentation of what you re reading now what s new on your device and what your nook friends may suggest some kindle ebooks are beginning to come with real page numbers that correspond to specific isbn printings but many still don t display page numbers especially free ebooks typing on the on-screen qwerty keyboard is surprisingly quick and easy this is the kindle to get if you want to take notes in the margins or if you simply can t put up with the entry-level kindle s quirky cursor-based on-screen keyboard which is much much slower one interesting new feature is x-ray tap on the screen and the kindle will display passages from the book that mention ideas or concepts along with descriptions from wikipedia and shelfari right now it only works in roughly 1 000 books amazon is promising at least a few thousand for launch time i tested x-ray on around the world in eighty days the feature offered an interesting array of topics although the barcode-like position guides for where each word was located in the text were tough to

been discontinued and replaced with an updated model kindle paperwhite as of september 2012 read amazon s new kindles everything you need to know for more information here it is folks the kindle we at cnet have been wanting for a while a 99 e-ink e-reader with a touch-screen interface in a smaller lighter body and that does away with the integrated keyboard of its predecessor while retaining extras like audio support and on step-up versions free 3g wireless for frequent travelers what s not to like well not much but in the ever-competitive world of e-readers in which your nearest competitor barnes amp noble drops the price of its nook simple touch e-reader to 99 in advance of the kindle touch s arrival the devil s in the details so read on to find out why we think this is an excellent e-reader--but certainly not your only choice versions if you re shopping for an e-ink kindle in 2011 you ve got several options amazon.com is still selling last year s model now dubbed the kindle keyboard for 99 to 189 unless you have a particular affinity for hard keyboards don t buy it amazon also has the entry-level kindle a perfectly serviceable e-reader you can buy at the insanely low price of 79 30 more if you don t want special offers ads the catch there s no touch screen that s where the kindle touch comes in amazon was late to the touch-screen game beaten to the market by sony kobo and barnes amp noble but it s made up for that with a market-leading 99 entry-level price now matched by two of those three competitors the kindle touch comes in four versions two wi-fi models 99 for the ad-supported special offers version and 139 with no ads and two 3g models 149 with special offers and 189 without all those versions are enough to make your head spin so which one s best for you our advice is to opt for the 3g version only if you re a frequent traveler or don t have easy access to wi-fi otherwise skip it more importantly you should only buy the special offers versions remember the ads only appear on the screensavers and as a small banner on the index screen--never within your reading material and frankly we ve already used the special offers several times--mostly to buy discounted e-books besides if you ultimately decide you don t like the ads you always have the option to pay the extra dough to have amazon turn them off forever it s pretty much a no-lose scenario design while the basic kindle is the smallest and lightest of the three new kindles weighing 5.98 ounces the kindle touch is still quite compact measuring 6.5 inches long by 4.5 inches wide by 0.4 inch thick it s slightly narrower than the barnes amp noble nook simple touch but weighs almost exactly same at 7.5 ounces or 7.8 ounces for the 3g version when we reviewed the basic 79 kindle we surprisingly thought that it almost felt too light in the hand the light weight doesn t exactly make the device seem cheap ok maybe a little but it does give you the sensation that it s fragile and shouldn t be dropped the kindle touch by comparison feels a bit more substantive the kindle touch takes its name to heart except for the home key below the screen and the power switch bottom edge this is a buttonless device next to the power switch you ll find the headphone jack and micro-usb charging port amazon includes a usb cable but the actual charger will cost you 10 extra--it s annoying but thankfully any pc usb port or ipod/iphone charger and most cell phone chargers will also do the trick speaking of usb--you can connect the kindle touch to a computer to drag and drop mp3 audiobook or text files such as pdfs but there s otherwise no need to sync with a computer in fact if you re just interested in reading you ll never need to connect a kindle to a computer at all as books periodicals and even audiobooks can be purchased and downloaded straight over wi-fi or 3g cellular directly from the touch screen to further emphasize its audio chops the kindle touch has external speakers so even if you don t have headphones you can listen to mp3s audiobooks or the read-to-me feature more on those later listen to mp3s audiobooks or the read-to-me feature via headphones or the external speakers on the rear another nice touch worth mentioning if you order the touch or any kindle product from amazon s web site it ships prelinked to your amazon account there s an easy option to unlink and go through a quick setup wizard for a new account but the fact that it comes ready to go straight out of the box is yet another great why didn t they think of that sooner usability feature--you can be reading a book within 2 minutes of opening the box as it has with other models amazon has released a special kindle lighted leather cover for the kindle touch the cover has an integrated led light and while it s a bit overpriced at 59.99 it s really a killer add-on for those who like to read at night e-ink screens are not backlit and require a light source for reading amazon has moved away from the somewhat troublesome hook system it used for powering the lighted case and the kindle touch has a set of power contacts at the bottom of the device the screen it s important to note that this is literally the same 6-inch e ink pearl screen you ll find on all of those competing readers we mentioned and that s a good thing as avid readers we prefer the look and feel of an e-ink screen which is the closest you can get to the look and feel of real paper the other advantage of e-ink over lcd is the lack of glare which means you can read the kindle touch and its e-ink siblings in direct sunlight and in other bright lighting conditions of course the big attraction here is the new touch-screen interface a first for kindle e-ink e-readers like the nook simple touch the kobo ereader touch edition and sony s latest e-readers this one uses special neonode infrared technology to sense when you touch the screen--and it works very well though don t expect ipad-like responsiveness because of e-ink s inherently laggy nature the basic idea behind it is that small infrared sensors are built into the inside of the border around the screen and can sense where your finger is touching on the screen in fact you don t really have to touch the screen and can let your finger hover just a hair over the screen to get a response the touch-screen navigation is simple and intuitive--though some may miss having hard buttons for turning pages from a user-interface standpoint amazon has tweaked the kindle s screens to allow easier albeit arguably less precise finger navigation most folks will probably be able to jump right in with a menu and back buttons leading a very intuitive navigation process as we ve said in the past the touch-screen interface really lends itself to e-reading and we re glad to see it come to the kindle if you re the type who just opens and closes books from your library and does little else the new interface probably won t seem like a huge advancement and if that s the case you may well opt for the 79 nontouch kindle however where the new touch-screen interface really improves the user experience is when performing such tasks as looking up words in the dictionary or wikipedia using amazon s new x-ray feature more on that below changing font sizes and highlighting text and adding notes via the virtual keyboard you can also share highlighted passages on facebook and twitter right from the device you simply tap and hold on a word to bring up the built-in dictionary and navigate through menus by touch--no need to scroll around with a little directional pad as on the cheaper kindle amazon like barnes amp noble is continually tweaking the performance of its e-readers to improve battery life make accessing and downloading e-books easier and faster and speed up page turns slightly with less flashing e-ink readers used to have to refresh the screen with each page turn but now the screen flashes only every five to six pages with the kindle and nook touch for standard book navigation--turning pages--you simply swipe the screen forward or back or touch the right side of the screen to go forward and the left side to go back tapping the top of a page brings up an options menu as discussed above continue to next page 1 2 most viewed amazon kindle paperwhite special offers starting at 119.00 4.0 stars

touch type cover software wrap-up comments down close if sbn.openx.istablet else the microsoft surface is no minor thing to review especially when you consider the stakes for this product the tablet / laptop hybrid which was announced at a surprise event in los angeles back in june is not just a unique product in the market it s also the first of its kind for microsoft the company s foray into designing and building its own hardware is not exactly unheard of but competing directly with partners on pcs certainly is adding fuel to an already-crackling fire microsoft is making two distinct versions of the surface available the 499 and up surface with windows rt which runs a scaled back version of windows for arm chipsets and the yet-to-be-released surface with windows 8 pro a full-on intel-based windows machine with all the power you d expect from a modern laptop i ve been tasked with reviewing the former a product which competes in both price and functionality with the ipad and higher-end android tablets the device itself is an interesting new addition to a crowded market though windows rt touts a desktop environment which looks and feels very similar to windows 7 the os doesn t allow for legacy windows applications to be run or installed save for the office suite and a desktop version of internet explorer 10 furthermore new apps must be written for the tiled environment of windows 8 the new windows phone-influenced interface which seemingly defines microsoft s future so what to make of this strange hybrid is it the next logical step in computing a transmutable slab which offers the best of the past and the present or is it something else a half-step a feint a compromise can you really have it all as microsoft suggests or is the surface trying to go in too many directions at once video review video review hardware hardware and design microsoft is focused on clean simple lines microsoft surface rt pictures previous next view full gallery previous next jdocument.readyfunction j gallery3304911 .gallery the surface hardware is handsome indeed the rectangular slab is a magnesium alloy forged from what microsoft calls vapormg though it feels like thin stiff aluminum to the touch the device is wrapped edge-to-edge in the material which is treated in a black or nearly black paint job the backing is prone to fingerprints though it s easy to clean microsoft seems to be focused on clean simple lines both in windows 8 and its recent product designs and the surface reflects that in spades the sides bottom and top of the device edge back from the glass front in a slight taper making for an angular clean profile on the back of the surface there s a small strip of plastic that houses a camera and presumably wi-fi and bluetooth radios as well as the novel full-width kickstand that the company is touting as a key feature of the device the kickstand is indeed a unique addition to a tablet of this size and it s sturdy and works reasonably well i do have some niggles with it particularly the fact that its position can t be adjusted in any way meaning you have to like the angle the screen is at and live with it it was usually too upright in most scenarios i tried it in but not unusable by any means the kickstand also has extremely sharp metal edges which caused it to scratch a couple of wooden surfaces i found myself placing the surface on it s also not very useful on your lap unless you like to struggle you could use the kickstand to put the surface upright in portrait though it s not terribly stable and i wouldn t trust it to not fall over with the wrong kind of touch the front of the tablet is all screen save for a small camera and light embedded beneath the display at the top and a capacitive windows home button that sits centered in landscape the preferred orientation at the bottom along the top of the device you ll find a sleep / power button on the upper right edge on the left side is a set of volume rockers and a headphone jack while the right side boasts a usb jack micro hdmi port and the odd and difficult to use proprietary power jack a microsdxc slot hides underneath the kickstand i mean it s really hidden there s not even a little icon to indicate where it is the surface feels good when you hold it.. but it s hugealong the bottom edge of the device is a powerful magnet and dock connector which allows you to attach either the touch cover or the type cover accessories the magnet worked extremely well and both accessories are interesting experiments which have their plusses and minuses i ll talk about them more later on in the review the surface looks and feels pretty good when you re holding it.. but it is huge at 10.81 inches across in landscape and 0.37 inches thick it s not really that comfortable to hold in landscape for extended periods and in portrait it s laughably tall trying to hold the device upright to read a book in the kindle app felt about as ridiculous as taking a picture with a tablet maybe more ridiculous actually the surface seems to desperately want to be docked and on a desk or table rather than in your hands or on your lap after using it for an extended period of time it s hard to imagine bedtime reading or casual throw-it-in-a-bag use for this device it s nice that microsoft wanted to retain the 16 9 aspect ratio but i would have happily traded some of that wide real estate for a more portable comfortable device in comparison to a new ipad or nexus 7 the device seemed bulky awkward and just plain heavy that s especially telling considering that the thickness and weight of the surface and the ipad are nearly identical those extra inches matter overall microsoft has designed a beautiful tablet that s unfortunately more functional as a laptop.. on a desk the styling and components are incredibly well made and high quality but the form factor isn t svelte or small enough to really come across as a true hybrid specs display specs cameras display this isn t a speeds-and-feeds affair inside the surface you ll find an nvidia tegra 3 chipset 2gb of ram and either 32gb or 64gb of hardwired storage i tested the 64gb version you ll find the requisite wi-fi and bluetooth radios as well alongside a light sensor an accelerometer gyroscope and digital compass but no 3g or 4g radio options the surface has two microphones and a set of stereo speakers which sound decent though they sometimes distorted when i was playing back music or video the battery in the surface is a hefty 31.5 watt-hours that s solid but keep in mind the ipad is lighter and has a 42.5 watt-hour battery the device has two 720p cameras one on the front and one on the back which have surprisingly good low-light performance but are otherwise grainy and unremarkable you probably know how i feel about taking photos with a tablet but for video conferencing the front-facing shooter is quite good with a very wide field of view making for group conversations that don t require sardine-like packing of participants the surface has a fine set of specifications but this isn t a speeds-and-feeds affair in fact the device is in some ways all about the opposite of biggest and baddest microsoft has made a big deal about squeezing windows down to function on a more modest arm chipset with less ram on hand and the surface clearly shows off the realization of that work display the display on the surface is as mentioned a 16 9 screen which means wide but not very tall the display uses microsoft s cleartype technology which supposedly produces better looking graphics and typography even against displays with a much higher resolution hello new ipad the colors and blacks on the 10.6-inch screen do look stunning but all the technology in the world can t make up for pixels that aren t there at the size of the surface screen 1366 x 768 resolution leaves much to be desired and even though things are sharp text and some of the starker elements of the microsoft s new ui would clearly benefit from a higher res display on the other hand touch response was mostly excellent save for a few stalls and missed touches that i attribute to the software more than the hardware additionally multitouch worked well on the display though it s disappointing that the surface only does five-point touch when competition like the ipad can handle 11 at a time performance performance and battery life battery life was consistent and impressive overall performance on the surface was a bit hit or miss in terms of general ui responsiveness touch response speed and framerate of the tile interface windows desktop and most basic os functionality the surface felt incredibly speedy switching between apps was fast and fluid organizing and navigating the start screen felt snappy and live tiles flipped and updated smoothly and as expected many of the first-party apps particularly internet explorer in the new interface felt good to me but others left me wanting the native email application for instance could be slow to update and unresponsive to touch on a regular basis other apps both first and third-party could be slow to open then stall or crash altogether some 3d games such as rocket riot seemed fluid and natural while others staggered along seemingly struggling to pump out an acceptable frame rate when i was just dealing with the core os the surface felt like a lively sophisticated fast-moving new system but the deeper i got into apps and the more apps i opened the more the device seemed to bog down there were other issues too video playback in the browser was a spotty experience flash content didn t fare too well in either the desktop or new browser and some html5 playback stuttered and dropped frames during play i can t say for sure that the performance issues were due to a software problem hardware deficiency or some combination of the two i only know that my experience wasn t 100 percent consistent on the plus side my general takeaway is that the surface is a highly capable and highly enjoyable device to use most of the time and is likely in need of some bug fixing and optimization however that seems like it should have been done prior to the release of the product to the public battery life on the other hand was consistent and impressive on the surface microsoft claims that users can nab somewhere in the vicinity of eight hours on a single charge in mixed use my experience bore those numbers out and then some i was able to put the surface through a full day of relatively heavy use video playback and streaming document editing lots of web browsing app downloads game playing email twitter and more and still had some charge left that evening.. and into the next morning without having plugged it in overnight battery life on the surface seemed more akin to an ipad than a laptop which makes sense given the arm architecture in the same way i never worry about whether i ve charged the ipad recently i found myself carelessly leaving the surface off of the charger for extended periods and i think that s a good thing touch type cover touch and type cover it s time to type again microsoft isn t just introducing a new tablet it s got a couple of novel accessories up its sleeve too i m speaking of course about the clever hybrid products that do double duty as protective covers and physical keyboards called the touch cover and the type cover the touch cover has been more visible in microsoft s advertising of the surface and rightfully so not only is it a very new kind of product for tablets but the company is offering it in a variety of bright colors that are extremely eye catching while both the touch and type cover snap onto the bottom of the tablet using a set of pogo connectors and a strong magnet the touch cover is unique in that it s a physical keyboard with no moving parts instead there is a set of raised keys on the soft material-like surface and not just keys but a fully functional multitouch trackpad with two buttons on a desk or other flat surface the touch cover works reasonably well it doesn t come close to replicating a physical tactile keyboard but it does do a good job of reminding you where your fingers need to be i was surprised that it often took a little more pressure on the keys to get input to register but once i figured out the appropriate heaviness it wasn t too much of an issue my typing rate seemed to increase as i used the cover more though i found myself mistyping and having to correct and re-correct errors i had made it might be a matter of adjustment but it wasn t a completely pain-free experience the touch cover feels excellent on the device from a screen protection standpoint and it feels good when you wrap it over the back of the device as you d fold back a magazine or book the surface has a way of sensing what position the cover is in using its accelerometer though i did experience a few glitches where the cover was on the back of the surface but still sending chaotic key presses to the device luckily this issue was few and far between the type cover is another story altogether it s one of the best portable keyboards i ve ever used like the touch cover it functions as a screen protector but unlike the touch cover it has a full complement of great-feeling tactile keys typing on it was akin to working on my macbook air and i rarely made mistakes because of the size of the keyboard or the positioning of the keys it really was a joy to use i do have two issues with the accessory however the first is that it s a bit uncomfortable to use when it s wrapped around the back of the device feeling keys under your fingers is just not reassuring secondly a handful of times i had keys pop up slightly off of their retainer making for missed presses and the need to realign and replace the key where it should have been it s not a huge deal and it s certainly something that happens on laptop keyboards from time to time but with all of the action this accessory will see it is a little worrisome both covers are relatively expensive 119 for the touch cover and 129 for the type cover and both have plusses and minuses but i do think they make the surface a more attractive device and i think it s somewhat incomplete without at least one of them microsoft seems to agree hence its 599 bundle that includes the touch cover one caveat you don t get to pick your color so you might want to spend that extra 20 buy the pieces separately and show off your wild side software software traditional windows is only a small piece of the story i m not going to cover every aspect of windows 8 here partially because windows rt and windows 8 are very different beasts but also because we have a big in-depth review of the software right over here going into this write-up i tried to look at the surface with windows rt as a different kind of device one with a future yet to come a brand new tablet with a new os aimed at competing with and microsoft hopes besting the current tablets that are on the market while offering a lot of what makes a pc powerful this isn t a device that imitates your current laptop or tries to act exactly like a pure windows machine even though the core of this os is based on windows it s not just a windows pc legacy software can t be used and microsoft has expressly forbidden developers from creating applications for the windowed desktop environment there are really only five full applications that can be used in that space word excel powerpoint onenote and internet explorer yes notepad and paint are here as well but they re little more than glorified utilities in windows rt in that sense the windows environment you know is only a small piece of the story of the surface so let s start by getting this out of the way unless you are a heavy professional user of office you probably won t spend that much time in the windows part of the surface os the vast majority of your time for good reason will be lived inside the new tiled interface of this operating system modern ui or metro the start menu or whatever it is we re calling it today that is the os and i suspect it will be the only thing you see on a device like this come windows 9 time and there is no confusion you don t accidentally enter the traditional desktop by accident you have to want to be there and you have to be trying to accomplish specific tasks this is not a bad thing it s a very good thing but truth be told i found myself wondering why that environment exists at all in this os surely microsoft could have made cleaner and robust versions of its office suite for the new ui why choose to force users out into a less intuitive jarring interface if i had to bet i would say the company didn t have the time to properly convert the full-featured apps to the new ui but that s just a guess yes for the windows hardcore this is also windows you have a full file explorer control panels media viewers a command line if you want it access to usb devices external storage etc this acts and feels like windows but a windows with no apps i believe microsoft could have wrapped all of this functionality in a cleaner and more user-friendly interface thus keeping the user from shifting between two extremes why the company chose to go the route it went is a mystery perhaps only steve ballmer himself could unravel but my biggest fear about the surface has proven unfounded that is the fear that you would be constantly caught between two worlds you really do spend the majority of your time in the modern tile-based interface the other world is more like a memory a half-remembered dream you slip into and out of the new user experience the actual interface the tiled environment is a joy to use it s really really cool i found myself legitimately delighted by some of its functionality particularly its multitasking and side-by-side apps concept if you don t know how it works it s really simple upon booting up and signing into the surface which was a relatively painless process you re presented with a list of colorful tiles representing apps either by square icons or rectangular live spaces those spaces are also shortcuts to apps but they display information like recent messages or tweets to you weather conditions calendar events and so on widgets basically the list of tiles can be scrolled left to right and you can make as many groupings of tiles as you want you can pinch to zoom out and see an overview of tiles though i hardly every used this functionality these tiles encompass the new windows start menu the tiles are your main mode of travel but there are sets of hidden menus and actions which can be activated through gestures swiping from the right edge of the tablet to the left brings up a charms bar which gives you options to search share access devices like printers change settings or get back to your homescreen many of the options in this menu are context aware meaning that settings for all apps sharing options and search will always be accessible from this same spot it works very well once you get the hang of it if you swipe down from the top or up from the bottom of the surface display you get a context menu for in-app options or functions this is context aware based on what part of the app you re in if you swipe down all the way from the top to the bottom you quit the app like throwing it away flicking your finger quickly on the left edge of the screen towards the right will flip through apps you have open this is multitasking while swiping slowly and then pulling back will bring up a list of all the apps you have currently open finally you can pull an open app into either side of the app you re currently in and run that application side-by-side with another kind of like a smartphone display next to a larger tablet display this is especially useful for things like twitter mail or music apps all these gestures may sound complex but in ten minutes it feels completely natural they re good ideas and they feel fresh useful and intuitive windows rt certainly isn t as basic or immediately understandable as ios but it is extremely clever and charming in its own right i truly enjoyed using it details the devil as delightful as the new interface is it doesn t mean microsoft got this thing exactly right the fact that the strongest and most useful and notably most responsive applications are relegated to the old environment gives me pause add to that the fact that many of the new apps seem incomplete or buggy and you ve got a problem microsoft wants to compete with the ipad and presumably any android tablet that has any kind of foothold but it s not necessarily offering a better experience than other devices on the market even though this platform seems powerful i found myself frustrated with small things more often than i should have i already mentioned the mail app issues but it goes deeper than just some stuttering or crashing microsoft s implementation of exchange syncing on the surface and windows phone notably has an odd and bad way of handling threaded messages using only the subject as guidance for what to group that means that if you ve got three threads to different people with the subject hey which i do often they suddenly are grouped together in an annoying and confusing manner the mail app also formats your emails in rich text with no say in the matter it won t show pictures inline in messages rather it forces you to tap on every image you want to see in truth i actively avoided using the mail app if at all possible it was so touchy in testing that i was worried i would accidentally delete or misplace an email if i wasn t careful in the people app contacts weren t matching for me during the review period meaning i had duplicate contacts from my multiple accounts the only way around seeing all of these doubles or triples in my list was to turn off the visibility of some of the accounts and the duplicates still showed up when i searched for a contact elsewhere it should be noted that another editor testing windows 8 did not have the contact matching issue and believe it or not some of the buggy disappearing list scrolling i saw lots of in early versions of windows phone 7 reared its head while i was zooming through my contacts meaning the info momentarily blanked out and i lost my place there were of course plenty of good experiences to be had in the bundled apps internet explorer in the new ui is a terrific browser that displayed pages quickly and made navigating even complex websites easy through i had some issues with video playback most content loaded perfectly and scrolling and zooming was unflinchingly fast i was really surprised by how good it is and xbox music while a little difficult to understand at first is a great example of how playful and fresh this version of windows can be i particularly liked docking the player alongside another app and having full access to my library a handful of third-party apps worked really well and showed the promise of microsoft s platform like the new versions of skype and hulu plus both of which cleverly take advantage of the unique user interface concepts in windows 8 and rt but other third-party efforts were surprisingly amateur a case of microsoft not putting its best foot forward some well known apps such as cut the rope felt sluggish on the surface a problem i came across with a number of games the twitter app metrotwit strangely stopped issuing notifications after i had left the app for a short period of time though i did have better luck with tweetro the amazon kindle application had an extremely annoying bug which showed a jarring flash of a book graphic every time i turned a page and would sometimes have to load for absurd amounts of time between page turns nearly every app i tried crashed completely at least once while i was testing the tablet third and first-party one by one these problems might not seem like a big deal but together they undermine much of the good work done in rt and the surface this product is supposed to represent the future of windows and microsoft so why did i feel so frustrated so often while using it who is this for what is it supposed to be let me put it this way the surface does not seem like a better tablet than the ipad or the nexus 7 the two best products in the category as of this writing even though it has a very unique and useful interface and lots of hooks into microsoft s ecosystem it still lacks the polish and apps of those two devices is the mail client better here than the native mail client on the ipad or nexus no is the browser superior well it s an excellent browser one of the best i ve ever used on a mobile device but it s not wildly better than the ipad or nexus 7 offerings is the interface so much easier to use or so much more powerful that it would tip the hand of an average buyer not in my opinion is the app selection better or more robust in some way not by a long shot and there s no clear sign it will be anytime soon and i must ask how is it possible that in launching a massively important device like this microsoft couldn t muster up a single killer game title to pull in the xbox fanbase halo surface edition anyone the whole thing is honestly perplexing if this device is not as good as or better than the best tablet and not a complete alternative to a laptop who is this for what is it supposed to be wrap-up compare it microsoft surface for windows rt 7.0 verge score 8.5 user score write review good stuff ambitious new software solidly made handsome hardware full office suite with no compromise excellent battery life bad stuff performance is hit or miss weak ecosystem buggy software doesn t live up to hybrid promise instead of being no-compromise it often feels like more-compromise maybe i say this too often but i wanted to love this device actually i wanted to love the surface when i first saw it before i even got my hands on the review unit it made windows 8 make sense in a way other products had not and i could see a world where this kind of device was the only one i carried with me once i did get the review unit i wanted to love it even more and truth be told there is a lot here to love plenty but not enough for me right now the promise of the surface was that it could deliver a best-in-class tablet experience but then transform into the pc you needed when heavier lifting was required instead of putting down my tablet and picking up my laptop i would just snap on my keyboard and get my work done but that s not what the surface offers at least not in my experience it does the job of a tablet and the job of a laptop half as well as other devices on the market and it often makes that job harder not easier instead of being a no-compromise device it often feels like a more-compromise one there may be a time in the future when all the bugs have been fixed the third-party app support has arrived and some very smart engineers in redmond have ironed out the physical kinks in this type of product which prevent it from being all that it can be but that time isn t right now and unfortunately for microsoft the clock is ticking the breakdown more times than not the verge score is based on the average of the subscores

including its ability to run microsoft office connect to thousands of usb peripherals like printers and mice interact with your xbox 360 using the smartglass app and work with microsoft s unique keyboard covers including the flat yet actually usable touch cover however it has almost as many failings starting with the fact that very few apps are currently available for windows rt which can t run standard windows applications those apps rt does have sometimes behave in odd inconsistent ways office for example drops out of rt s touch-friendly user interface and into the classic windows desktop its display is disappointing especially in comparison to the ipad s retina display but also when compared to some similarly priced android tablets such as the asus transformer pad infinity show more its two cameras are also weak even by tablet standards as either a tablet or a replacement for a basic laptop the surface is also expensive selling for a minimum of 599 with the touch cover the windows rt ecosystem is likely to grow and microsoft seems committed to its radical reinvention of both the computer and its operating systems for now however if you live in microsoft office you re likely to be better served by a laptop running windows 8 if you don t and you re just looking for a solid tablet with many great touch-optimized apps get an ipad -- or at least for more apps to make their way to windows rt and the inevitable surface 2 '),(462,'2012-10-23 00:00:00',7.5,97,' slide 2 slide 3 slide 4 slide 5 slide 6 slide 7 slide 8 slide 9 slide 10 slide 11 slide 12 slide 13

launch with the new operating system windows 8 launches this week as well the tablet serves as ambassador and flagship for the touch-focused wildly risky windows grand experiment the surface excels thanks to its thoughtful design sensible implementation of its keyboard accessory and the innovations brought about by the interface formerly known as metro -- chief among them the gesture-driven menu system powerful search tool and incredibly cool and versatile split-screen feature unfortunately there s a price to pay for doing things differently i ve spent a week with this soldier for the windows cause and i predict that some of you will find metro s learning curve discouraging additionally apps support is dismal performance especially when using ie10 is slow at times and like the old guy in the club still hanging around after last call the traditional windows interface lingers on feeling embarrassingly out of place the surface isn t for everyone those looking for tons or even several pounds of apps should look elsewhere however it takes a legitimate swing at replacing your computer and comes closer to hitting the mark than any tablet before it microsoft surface and its keyboard get a day out pictures 1-2 of 13 scroll left scroll right on the surface so what keeps the surface from looking like just another generic black tablet honestly not that much but the features and aesthetic details that do set it apart are significant if not immediately apparent for one the surface sports a 10.6-inch screen which is only about 0.5 inch larger than most full-size mainstream tablets screens and 0.9 inch larger than the ipad s screen however this larger screen affords it a true 16 9 aspect ratio at a screen resolution of 1 366x768 pixels this aspect ratio matches most movies and tv shows eliminating the need for black bars at the top and bottom of the screen while movies shot in scope 2.35 1 will still display with black bars they re not nearly as all-encompassing as when watching the same movies on an ipad with its 4 3 aspect ratio the surface s unique 10.6-inch display in full effect credit josh miller/cnet then there s the surface s beveled back which contributes to its sleek somewhat industrial-looking metallic aesthetic it looks practical without being cold and just feels like a high-quality device that microsoft cut few corners to make speaking of which the corners are somewhat rounded but do tend to dig into the palms a bit when you hold the tablet in both hands the entire chassis is surrounded by a full magnesium vapormg pronounced vapor mag outer casing that s supposedly both scratch- and wear-resistant however scratches are already beginning to appear on my unit table.geekbox th table.geekbox tr.even .ratinggood .ratingaverage

re already at the start screen from left a speaker grille micro-hdmi and full-size usb 2.0 port credit josh miller/cnet along the right edge from the top are a speaker grille a micro-hdmi port a full usb 2.0 port and the power port which magnetically attaches the power cable at the far right of the top edge is a lone power/sleep button the left edge features an additional speaker grille a headphone jack and a satisfyingly tactile and clicky volume rocker seated toward the bottom of the left edge is an inch-long groove that allows you to easily pull out the built-in kickstand and prop the tablet up the microsd port located under the kickstand can be accessed in a somewhat awkward fashion once the stand is engaged on the bottom edge is another array of magnets where the touch and type cover keyboards connect the surface s built-in kickstand tilts it back about 10 degrees credit josh miller/cnet the kickstand decisively locks into position when activated reclining the tablet back about 10 degrees i m a huge fan of built-in kickstands on tablets and this is the best implementation i ve seen so far it s sturdy easy to work and yes delivers a satisfying sound and feeling when both engaged and disengaged the tablet weighs 1.5 pounds but doesn t feel noticeably heavier than the ipad at least not when held in the middle of the tablet held lightly on the edge however and the surface s long body begins to work against it as the unsupported weight dips at the free end the surface is a bit bulkier than most premium mainstream 10-inchers and you can probably blame the kickstand s inclusion for that added girth microsoft did its best balancing the tablet s weight and while i appreciate its wide screen it feels a bit too long and awkward when held and works much better with its kickstand engaged the microsd port is hidden quite effectively by the disengaged kickstand only when it engages is the memory port revealed credit josh miller/cnet touch cover it s a weird decision to not include the touch cover with the basic surface package saying the cover has been prominent in microsoft s surface marketing campaign is an obvious understatement to anyone who s seen the first commercial the cover is 120 if you buy the basic 499 surface and comes packed in with the 599 and 699 packages after several days of use it s clear to me that owning the touch cover or type cover see below is essential to getting the complete surface experience the touch cover acts as both a screen cover and a physical keyboard it connects magnetically to the bottom of the tablet with a very satisfying and kind of addictive crunch sound microsoft has admittedly spent a lot of time getting this sound right and thanks to the same parts of our brains that won t let us stop eating those oh-so-crunchy pringles once we ve started it s been largely successful the many colors of the touch cover credit josh miller/cnet the magnets keep the surface adhered very firmly to the keyboard allowing you to hold the connected device by just the keyboard itself with the tablet dangling underneath from this position you can even swing it around a bit as long as you don t get too crazy without the parts disconnecting as they stay more strongly bonded than the ipad and its touch cover speaking of which just as the smart cover does with the ipad when the touch cover folds over the surface s screen it automatically puts the tablet to sleep microsoft claims that it ll take most people four to five days to get used to typing on the touch cover that s a fair estimate the biggest issue i had was getting accustomed to its nearly flat keys which don t depress when you strike them after years of typing mostly on depressible keys i found myself overcompensating here which resulted in sore fingertips on my part by the second day however the soreness was gone the surface works fairly well on your lap just make sure you don t lean over it that kickstand will disengage in a flash credit josh miller/cnet typing on my lap definitely took some getting used to the cardboardlike feel of the touch cover is awkward at first and if you re not careful -- and not wearing pants -- the corners of the kickstand will dig into your thighs also if you tend to hunch over while you work the tablet can easily tip back disengaging the kickstand the surface s wide body affords the touch cover a more spacious area to type on which makes a significant difference in hand and wrist comfort simply put your hands get to spread out a bit more compared with other tablet keyboards like the ones made for asus transformer line as well as keyboard accessories for the ipad soft and smooth is the bottom of the touch cover soft smooth...and soft credit josh miller/cnet on most tablets before even striking my first key i turn off that annoyingly shrill tablet keyboard typing sound effect thankfully the surface s typing sound effect is less like glass breaking and more like small rhythmic bongo drums since its keys don t depress that bongo sound is the only feedback you get and is therefore essential to becoming accustomed to typing on the unique-feeling keyboard after a few days though your skills may grow beyond the need of drum sounds the touch cover has enough smarts built into it to know when it s been flipped under the tablet and its buttons will cease functioning in order to prevent any unwanted typing flip it back to its normal position and it begins functioning again in less than a second nary missing a beat the bottom of the default black it also comes in red pink blue and white touch cover is a soft feltlike material that covers the screen when folded over it as a cover it doesn t necessarily look appropriate for a high-end sturdily built tech device but definitely feels right when you re carrying it in your hands they actually remained attached despite the power of gravity credit josh miller/cnet the touch cover is an incredibly useful and capable accessory that feels as essential to the surface experience as the kickstand but given the choice i d recommend most buyers spring for the 130 type cover keyboard instead it s all the best things about the touch cover but with very comfortable wide depressible keys it is a bit thicker than the touch cover but not by much if you re looking to make use of the surface s capability as a productivity machine you ll definitely want to spring for one of these cover keyboards hardware features the surface houses a 1.3ghz nvidia tegra 3 cpu as its brains and comes in both 32gb and 64gb varieties its microsd card slot supports up to 128gb cards and the tablet includes 2gb of ram it has 802.11 a/b/g/n wi-fi support bluetooth 4.0 a gyroscope an accelerometer and a built-in compass but no gps the surface does not house a gps so why am i outside using it and why does it look like italy credit josh miller/cnet metro ...i mean start wait what is this interface called again the surface runs on windows rt the surface pro is coming early next year and will run on a full version of windows 8 windows rt is split between two different interfaces a tile-based interface formerly known as metro that includes the start screen and a somewhat traditional windows interface called desktop desktop includes most control panels and settings one would expect on a windows operating system in addition to a skinned version of internet explorer 10 made to look like ie9 and a free copy of office 2013 preview no additional apps can be added to the desktop interface however though microsoft no longer calls its new interface metro and has not given it a new name for the sake of clarity i m going to continue calling it metro here if you own an xbox 360 you ll already be very familiar with metro s look each app is represented by a tile and each can be arranged into different groups groups can further be zoomed out and named as you see fit tiles can also be made smaller or larger the charms bar delivers context info and options for the app you have open at the time credit screenshot by eric franklin/cnet swiping inward from the right bezel brings up the charms menu which consists of search share start devices and settings this menu is context-sensitive so depending on which app you have open selecting settings for example will deliver you the settings for that particular app swiping from the left bezel into the screen launches the most recent app and if you swipe right then left you ll get a list of recent apps swiping from the top or bottom bezel reveals additional app options at the bottom of the screen and finally swiping from the top bezel to the bottom closes an app the split-screen features lead to true productivity credit screenshot by eric franklin/cnet this is obviously different from other tablet interfaces and it s a lot of new stuff to learn some users will be discouraged by the unfamiliarity of things i know i was but those who stick with it will discover that s it s actually an elegant tablet interface selecting search from the charms menu allows you to search within the current primary app share allows you to quickly e-mail information from the current app or share it via social networks using the people social app which integrates twitter and facebook start toggles between home and the last app that was opened devices is a list of hardware you currently have networked with the tablet that can interact with the current app including microsd cards and printers your metro global settings are called pc settings more options here and fewer in desktop would be nice credit screenshot by eric franklin/cnet and finally settings accesses the basic wireless volume and screen brightness as well the settings for the currently opened app also available from this menu is pc settings while most of the options here are self-explanatory some are just poorly organized for example the general list feels too cluttered and most of what s found there would feel much more appropriate in a separate keyboard or typing settings list also settings like screen timeout which is usually easily accessible in most tablet interfaces are instead located in a windows desktop control panel here this wouldn t be so bad if the windows desktop had somehow been redesigned and optimized for touch as it stands now navigating through a traditional windows interface can be a frustrating experience continue to next page 1 2 editors top picks 1 apple ipad 4th generation starting at 462.99 4.5 stars 2 google nexus 7 16gb starting at 189.95 4.0

the web or microsoft office constantly the surface has very good hardware and some innovative design but microsoft office rt is the killer app that comes to the surface and makes it shine by joel santo domingo the microsoft surface with windows rt 699 as tested is microsoft s first entry into the wild world of tablets priced to compete with the apple ipad the surface tablet with 64gb of storage comes with a 10.6-inch five-point multi-touch screen as is it s aimed at users that want to do more than simply consuming media and websites with innovative keyboard covers that make some of the more expensive windows 8 tablets docking solutions look absolutely clunky by comparison plus it has an ace in the hole that makes it feel like a real computer the surface comes with a full copy of microsoft office 2013 home and student edition the surface has the same user interface as upcoming windows 8 laptops and tablets thanks to microsoft s windows rt operating system however since the tablet uses windows rt and a more economical arm processor the surface isn t compatible with the majority of existing software made for windows 7 and xp this is the conundrum we find ourselves in

.reviewproducts span.checkbox .clickfunction design and features the surface certainly looks like the prototypical post-pc device its tapered and squared off sides make it look more like a prop from the avengers than one of the rounded tablets on the market right now the surface measures roughly 7 by 11 by 0.37 inches hwd making it smaller than the apple macbook air 11-inch but a smidge longer than the current apple ipad our review unit is the 699 top-of-the-line version from microsoft which includes a surface touch cover the touch cover resembles an apple ipad smart cover in that it protects the screen and also puts it to sleep and wakes its up by closing and opening the cover it s made of a synthetic material that protects the screen from fingerprints and even small amounts of liquid the big difference lies in the pressure-sensitive film keyboard on the inside of the touch cover it will make you forget that clunky keyboard on the atari 400 ever happened the touch cover keyboard is one of the most responsive ones we ve ever used and when installed turns the surface into the quasi-laptop the type cover is a little thicker but uses real keyboard keys for more tactile feel when you type view all 10 photos in gallery the touch cover and type cover both latch on the bottom of the surface with a proprietary magnetic latching mechanism the latch is both simpler and more intuitive than the latches we ve seen on other convertible tablets like the one on the hp elitepad 900 and asus transformer pad infinity tf700 if you hold the bottom of the surface about a half-inch from the magnetic latch on either cover the built-in magnets complete the job automatically with a satisfying click like in microsoft s videos you can hold the surface by the cover while letting the tablet portion swing in midair and the latch won t come free though the magnetic latch is strong it takes virtually no effort to remove the cover with a free hand there s just enough force resisting the act of detaching the cover to make sure you know you really want to detach the cover and are not just tugging on it this means you can pull the surface across a table by its cover and still not have it detach but then pick the combo up and remove the cover quickly with a quicker tug .zd-video function c if window.jwplayer document.readyfunction k new array f .extendc jwplayerthis.id.setupf loading.. the cover is supplemented by a metal kickstand that spans the back of the surface it folds out easel-style and props the surface up at a comfortable angle you can also use the kickstand when you don t have the cover installed like on the 499 surface base model unfortunately the kickstand s angle is not adjustable the surface leans back at about 22 degrees from vertical about 68 degrees from horizontal which is fine for use while you re seated the kickstand swings out easily but microsoft molded a finger catch only into the left-hand side of the surface to help pull out the kickstand if you try to open the kickstand with your right hand it will be more difficult as the kickstand rests flush on the back of the tablet under the kickstand is a microsdxc card reader capable of doubling the internal 64gb of storage the base and midpriced surface tablets come with 32gb of storage so you ll have to use the micro sd card slot sooner or later on those models the 720p hd front-facing camera is angled straight out but the back panel camera also 720p is angled up 22 degrees to offset the angling caused by the kickstand that way you can capture whatever is behind the surface when it is propped on a table or other horizontal surface the angled camera lens also means that you ll have to tilt the tablet a bit if you want to take a handheld picture with the surface the surface improves on the ipad and most android tablets by having more i/o ports a full sized laptop will of course have more ports but the surface comes with a full-sized usb 2.0 port a headphone jack and a micro hdmi port microsoft calls it a micro hd port and sells a micro hd-to-hdmi port adapter 39.99 list as well as a micro hd-to-vga adapter 39.99 list however when we hooked up an off the shelf micro-hdmi-to-hdmi cable to the surface we were able to hook up to and use a hdmi monitor without any issues the surface supports extending windows rt to the external screen as well as mirroring the tablet s screen on the external display this means you can use the surface in a dual-monitor configuration just like a desktop or laptop the usb 2.0 port lets you use external peripherals like scanners printers keyboards mice and external hard drives speaking of mice we were able to pair the surface to a microsoft wedge touch mouse and use it the mouse automatically connected itself via bluetooth after we woke the surface from a sleep state or when we turned the mouse itself off then on again back to top 1 2 3 .. '),(464,'2012-10-23 00:00:00',8.0,97,' surface microsoft s new tablet photo by ariel zambelich/wired nobody asked me about my surface i tried flashing it all over the place but despite my best efforts no one seemed curious at victrola coffee roasters in seattle i sat in the front window with a hot pink touch cover attached intentionally conspicuous nobody mentioned it at the airport i broke it out at the large open-air counter of a crowded bar i sat in a seat at the gate facing the walkway pounding away at its keys on my lap on a virgin america flight crowded with techies i sat up front and kept it on my tray table the entire time swiping from app to app on san francisco s muni transit system i tentatively typed in my seat afraid it may be snatched on the crowded train but no one said a word the only person to comment on it was a tsa agent at the seattle airport who told me i didn t need to take my ipad out of my bag that s too bad although nobody asked microsoft s new tablet is an altogether curious device it s something completely new and different it is in some ways better than an ipad in some ways worse it s brilliant and yet it can be puzzling as well confoundingly so at times it s a tablet of both compromises and confusion it is a true hybrid neither fully a desktop nor mobile device that s reflected in all sorts of ways it is wi-fi only but won t run traditional windows applications it has a full-featured keyboard and runs microsoft office but it s certainly meant to be touched and swiped and tapped it s different brightcove.createexperiences let s at least get this out of the way this is one of the most exciting pieces of hardware i ve ever used it is extremely well-designed meticulous even the backside kickstand can serve as a metaphor for the entire device close it and it sits flush with the back of the tablet it s so tightly integrated if you didn t know it was there you d think it was just a seam for the battery compartment it has three hinges one of which is just to give it a satisfying sound when opening or closing snap it s designed to be like a car door it s designed to make you use it and it s quite sturdy to boot in microsoft s lab we saw surfaces that had been opened and closed hundreds of thousands of times they still snapped open and shut like they were new we wanted to see how easy it was to break one it s very possible but you have to really try we did manage to break off the kickstand by gradually leaning onto it but i had to put nearly my full weight onto the tablet before the kickstand snapped off people will break the hinge but i don t think as often or predictably as say the glass rear panel of an iphone 4 or 4s one other nitpick the kickstand has a small fingerhold to make it easy to open but this is on the left-hand side of the device most people are right-handed and then there is the 3-millimeter-thin touch cover keyboard ever since microsoft first unveiled the surface this has been a big question mark does it really snap on and off so easily is it usable does it even work yes to everything it s actually quite fantastic on this miniature keyboard that has no actual physical keys keystrokes fire as fast as you can type them there is no lag there is however a learning curve i struggled mightily with typos and finger placement for the first 24 hours my left wrist hurt like hell the pinkie and ring finger on my left hand were cramped but by day three my hands began to relax and i was typing quickly and for the most part accurately after a week i powered along at 90 words per minute it s not the same speed i hit on a full size keyboard and i still have typos galore though far fewer but given how much i ve improved in a week it s impressive oddly it is perhaps less effective as a cover than a keyboard it folds over nicely but doesn t stay closed as well as i d like several times i opened my bag to a glow like something out of pulp fiction to find the surface had lit up as the touch cover came open inside the touch cover a 120 accessory that comes bundled with the two higher-priced surface tablets photo by ariel zambelich/wired the type cover 130 sold separately which has actual keys performs even more poorly as a cover but it s a spectacular keyboard i could hammer away on it at approximately normal speed from the get-go and made fewer typos one issue i did have with the type cover was the accidental pressing of a key apparently at some point i pressed the shift key for eight seconds which launched a filter keys setting an accessibility feature meant for users with palsy and other disabilities that may cause them to inadvertently press keys from that moment on the keyboard basically did not work and because windows 8 and windows rt are so cloud-connected this setting propagated itself across all my other windows devices it was an easy fix and microsoft says a software update that prevents this from happening is on the way but i thought it spoke to how easy it can be to inadvertently do bad things with the type cover the 720p hd cameras front and rear are junk there s no other way to put it the camera has a significant lag time when you re taking shots and the image quality looks about like the last photo you snapped with your razr v3 it should be however fine for skype just don t expect nana and papa to be able to see their little grunions clearly photo by ariel zambelich/wired one of the compromises microsoft made with the surface is its display it boasts a 1366 x 768 pixel 10.6-inch screen it looks nice but in the age of high-density displays that seems weak this was a trade-off microsoft made to achieve all-day battery life it promises that its cleartype rendering technology and surface s low-light-refracting screen will make up for the difference in fact it claims that there are a mere three units of human perception out of 116 of difference between this and a retina display eh maybe we ran two blind display tests pitting the surface rt against a third-generation retina display ipad we ran two blind tests pitting the surface rt against a third-generation retina display ipad both tablets were side by side in a room with ambient light from large windows we cranked the brightness all the way up and hid the devices behind a sheet of heavy cardboard with two holes of equal size cut into it so viewers could only see the screens we then asked members of wired s staff to come in and judge for themselves without knowing which device they were viewing in our video test running an hd version of the avengers twice as many viewers preferred the surface to the ipad six to three two others expressed no preference most noted that the difference in video quality was negligible text was an entirely different story we pulled up a page from the new york times website that had multiple typefaces and an image and allowed testers to zoom in or out and scroll the screens up and down to each person s comfort level it was a blowout every single person expressed a preference for the ipad display in most cases a strong one multiple people described it as no contest surface pricing 500 32gb with no touch cover 600 32gb with touch cover 700 64gb with touch cover this discrepancy between video and text is reflected in its hardware in another way as well the surface s 10.6-inch display has a 16 9 aspect ratio that s fantastic for watching movies when it s in landscape mode just like a movie theater when the video makes full use of the screen it s really an enjoyable experience all the more because of the kickstand which frees you up from having to hold the tablet while you watch but it s also lousy for reading when you hold it in portrait mode just like a book which to me at least is the more natural way to hold a device when you re reading because it s so long those 1.5 pounds really start to feel heavy it gets uncomfortable quickly then there is the build quality itself which is excellent microsoft developed its own magnesium molding process for the vapormg body it s solid and well built with nice lines sturdy even microsoft showed us a drop test by letting a surface fall from a chest-high height i duplicated this by literally throwing it at the floor but to no ill effect finally battery life it took me just over 11 hours to run it all the way down in a typical use setting typing in documents running apps watching videos photo by ariel zambelich/wired this is not a windows 8 machine that s the fundamental thing you need to know about it it s a windows rt device that means that none of your traditional x86 programs will run on it you will only be able to run windows store applications which makes it curious that there is a desktop mode at all which there is what is it there for there are a handful of system applications and a suite of office apps but otherwise it seems like it s just going to cause confusion the old windows desktop is a very odd interface element on this device i think microsoft should have cleanly pulled the band-aid off and ditched the desktop metaphor altogether leave that for desktop computers but in terms of interface elements windows rt works much like windows 8 it is delightfully gesture-friendly and microsoft has clearly spent much time thinking about and creating an entirely new interface swapping between apps by swiping onto the screen from the left side using semantic zoom to pinch and zoom out on all your onscreen elements and the ability to kill running apps by dragging down from the top of the screen are all gestures i miss tremendously when using other devices i have even found myself absentmindedly trying to use them on other operating systems and that s great it means they work i used it as my primary computer for several days there were applications i missed and i would never want it to be my only computer the keyboard and screen are just too small but it worked i was fine likewise i m already addicted to the charms the five options for search share start devices and settings that fire with a right-side swipe or via dedicated keys on the touch and type covers the search charm which lets you search both universally and within specific apps is particularly hot but dive past the operating system and things drop off in short there just aren t enough apps while you ll find apps for just about everything you want to do there aren t enough options i missed apps like dropbox and 1password and rdio the versions of word excel and powerpoint are well word excel and powerpoint i ll admit to not trying anything complex with excel during my testing period or ever for that matter but they did everything i expected unlike apps that run in metro excuse me modern ui-style apps you can view several windows at once on the desktop also all have application chrome buttons and menus and other onscreen elements banished by microsoft s modern ui style you can use touch with these apps but they really demand a keyboard and trackpad to work well what s not in the office suite is outlook microsoft s mail program has improved tremendously from its early iterations in preview versions however it still isn t well-suited to power users if you deal with lots of e-mail every day there just isn t enough screen real estate to display messages web browsing works well i liked having the ability to swap between multiple browser windows by right clicking but the address bar on the bottom side is something i still haven t gotten used to it makes sense when you are using the device in touch mode because that s where your thumbs naturally land but it s just plain odd with a keyboard the type cover a 130 accessory photo by ariel zambelich/wired yes you can use it as your only computer i would never have made that claim about an ipad or android tablet but if you only need to live in microsoft office and the web and e-mail and use your computer for media consumption you ll do great with this i used it as my primary computer for several days there were applications i missed and i would never want it to be my only computer the keyboard and screen are just too small but it worked i was fine this is a great device it is a new thing in a new space and likely to confuse many of microsoft s longtime customers people will have problems with applications especially when they encounter them online and are given an option by internet explorer to run them only to discover this won t work but overall it s quite good certainly better than any full-size android tablet on the market and once the application ecosystem fleshes out it s a viable alternative to the ipad as well wired fast to charge slow to die amazingly fluid gesture-driven interface kickstand type cover office applications mean it can pull double duty as a functional laptop type cover is the phattest skinny thing since mike d omg a usb port on a tablet i m totally charging up my iphone with this

video review design specs cameras lightning port performance software wrap-up comments down close if sbn.openx.istablet else ah to review the iphone 5 what a blessing and what a curse it s actually funny to think that there was a time not that long ago that the iphone wasn t even a thing let alone an iconic part of pop culture a time when an apple-made phone was just a fantasy a blogger s fever-dream a secret glimmer in the eye of steve jobs and his team of engineers and designers but the iphone has become very real in fact it s grown up moved out and taken over the world well half the world anyhow these days the iphone isn t just components on a breadboard in a lab in cupertino it s the device by which all others are measured and that makes for some interesting measuring indeed the new iteration of apple s phone is everything it should be faster smarter thinner and lighter it boasts lte data speeds improved cameras a larger screen with a higher resolution and a design which while not groundbreaking is unquestionably beautiful but it s also very much the iphone you ve seen before apple s ios 6 software is not a leap forward but a small jump and the phone design is an evolution of the iphone 4s not a revolutionary new spin so does the new iphone 5 retain its title as mvp in smartphones or is it just another contender in a big big game read on for my full review and find out video review video review design design and hardware until you ve held it you haven t seen it iphone 5 review pictures previous next view full gallery previous next jdocument.readyfunction j gallery3130905 .gallery you may think you ve seen this device before but trust me until you ve held the new iphone you really haven t seen it at all while the basic design of the phone mimics the look of the iphone 4 and iphone 4s the actual components materials sizing and weight make it seem like another device entirely the iphone 5 retains nearly the exact shape of the iphone 4 with its rounded corners glass-covered fa ade and metal band running around the edges of the device where the 5 differs is its brushed aluminum backing capped by glass on the top and bottom and the placement of the screen and back within the housing previously both sat above the metal band pushed off the surface of the phone now they re integrated and flush with the band removing the harsh step from one surface to the other it s a minor detail but one you sense immediately when you re holding the phone you ll also immediately sense how little it weighs the iphone 5 feels extremely light in your hand weighing just 3.9 ounces compared to the iphone 4s s 4.9 ounces that makes for a device that almost doesn t seem heavy enough when you first pick it up in fact when i first handled it after the announcement it nearly went flying out of my hands truly something to behold the phone is also thinner and of course taller combined with the lighter weight it feels somehow smaller in your hands despite that new 4-inch display apple moved the headphone jack to the bottom of the phone which is a welcome change in my opinion it also slightly tweaked some of the details on the device like the grid on the speakers and the more polished streamlined beveled edges on the sides of the phone the mirrored angular rims give the phone a glint akin to jewelry something i noted in my first hands-on with the device in all while the iphone 5 might look familiar the sheer attention to fit and finish in its build lends it a sense of quality and craftsmanship that far too many devices lack the new design particularly the black version which has a kind of sinister simplicity to it is truly something to behold specs specs display sound in the past apple has often treated feeds and speeds as an afterthought something that seemed like an annoyance rather than an opportunity the company appeared to be leaving the specs race behind in its march towards the post pc future it s been designing but the folks in cupertino have come out swinging with the latest iphone even though apple demurred on some facts like clock speed inside the iphone 5 you ll find a new dual-core a6 cpu running at a reported 1ghz 1gb of ram between 16gb and 64gb of storage i tested the 64gb version and an assortment of radios supporting wi-fi 802.11a/b/g/n on both 2.4ghz and 5ghz frequencies 3g and lte on both cdma and gsm networks and a gps chip of course lte speeds were excellent on the device and general performance seemed excellent easily surpassing what i m accustomed to on the 4s which is no slouch more on both of these points later the device also features new cameras an 8 megapixel shooter on back and a 1.2 megapixel version around front and sports a compass proximity sensor ambient light sensor gyroscope and accelerometer display as you may have heard apple has increased the size of the display on the iphone 5 to 4 inches at an 1136 x 640 resolution as opposed to the 3.5-inch screens that have dominated every other model in the line prior to the release of the new phone there were many people who argued that the 3.5-inch display was scientifically perfect having been engineered to match the average reach of a thumb and a larger screen would create all sorts of usability problems undoubtedly those poor individuals are undergoing surgery as we speak in the hopes that they may someday be able to reach the upper left corner of the iphone 5 s screen with their right-hand thumb i can tell you i ve had no such troubles but then again i have huge monster-like hands in other areas a new treatment has been utilized on the display which apple claims produces brighter colors as well as deeper blacks while reducing display thickness in a side-by-side comparison with the iphone 4s it did look better to my eyes though next to the excellent screen of the higher-resolution htc one x the improved imaging was less apparent other than the additional row of visible icons and some extra emails in view the new screen size is put to weirdly little use in the software yes apps show more information but nowhere in the os is the additional screen real estate utilized for anything that would make sense.. you know like an area for notifications that doesn t interfere with other onscreen activities more on this below as well sound and reception the sound on the new iphone is crystal clear for both incoming audio on the earpiece or speaker and outgoing audio from the mic on the device or at least that s what callers told me apple has included three microphones on the new device to pick up sound as well as help with noise reduction and it seems to be working the speaker was especially loud and clear for calls and playing back audio but never distorted or otherwise bad sounding in a way that made me feel life wasn t worth living as far as reception was concerned i had only one noticeable dropped call but it occurred while riding in a cab through manhattan not exactly the best place in the world to make and receive cellular phone calls overall i was happy with the results earpods apple has included a new type of earbud with the iphone 5 called earpods the partially in-ear headset seems considerably more robust than the previous throwaway pair that apple included with older devices sound from the odd looking white semi-spheres was clear though a bit bass heavy the buds still don t fit in my ears and do feel as if they re going to fall right out when i m walking around a problem i had with the older versions as well however the warm throb they produce is markedly better than before i think i still prefer the cheap rha ma-350 earbuds you can buy on amazon for around 40 but as the bundled free pair the earpods do a fine though not revolutionary job cameras cameras the camera is stunning iphone 5 camera shots previous next view full gallery previous next jdocument.readyfunction j gallery3130845 .gallery the new camera on the iphone 5 is absolutely stunning let me be clear it s one of the best cameras i ve ever used on a smartphone and a fine camera by point-and-shoot standards the pictures from the isight shooter on the back of the device look crisp clear and ultra-defined the depth of field is shallow enough that you re able to produce shots that look dramatic without verging into parody wider shots looked fantastic as well and macro performance was excellent as i expected color reproduction was a little bit blown out compared to other devices though actually somewhat better than the 4s as it s less artificially saturated i wouldn t say the exaggerated hues are a dealbreaker by any measure as expected the full hd video was no slouch either capturing mostly shake-free content that looks just as good as still images video processing seemed especially speedy on the phone and uploads on lte were of course totally awesome the new front-facing camera was surprisingly good at snapping the hundreds of self portraits i took while testing the phone the camera didn t improve my looks but i was able to study the increasing amount of gray hair and wrinkles each iphone review gives me in painstaking detail on the software side not much is new save for the much-touted panorama mode if you don t understand panorama photography it allows you to pan across a large scene at a constant pace snapping photos as the phone s software stitches them together in one big.. panoramic picture ios implements this mode better than most devices though the guided movement isn t novel many current dedicated cameras and even android devices contain similar functionality that said the results produced by the iphone 5 were markedly better than most though low-lighting did cause some noticeable noise and depending on how slowly and smoothly you move your hand you can take shots as high as 30 megapixels if you re used to the iphone 4s camera the new shooter won t seem like a massive change in quality but side-by-side there s definitely a bump in definition and clarity in the images the iphone 5 produces perhaps challengers like nokia s lumia 920 will be able to knock apple off of its throne here but right now the iphone 5 is the device to have in your pocket if you re leaving the point-and-shoot at home lightning port lightning port the new lightning port apple introduced caused something of a stir in the world of accessory makers as well as users who ve collected countless iphone add-ons over the years all of which utilize the now-old 30-pin dock connector though apple will make adapters available some functionality will be lost in translation the new connectors won t support video out or ipod-out which will render some setups non- or partially-functioning this is particularly true for automakers some of whom have already released statements noting reduced operation when the adapter is in use the port itself which is roughly the size of a micro usb jack but position agnostic you can insert the plug either way doesn t bring much new functionality either it s usb 2.0 on the other end so sync speeds won t suddenly crank up the use of the smaller plug seems to be almost entirely about downsizing components which is fine though in the short term it s sure to annoy a handful of customers the lightning port doesn t bring new functionality performance performance faster performance on the iphone 5 was not exactly unexpected every year apple bests itself in the speed of operation for its phones and i had no doubt the company would accomplish a bump in the new device after touting what the a6 processor and its gpu could do on stage at its event two weeks ago i knew that the iphone 5 would feel faster than its predecessor my only surprise was that the increase in speed wasn t quite as noticeable between the 4s and the 5 that may have more to do with the still-excellent performance of the iphone 4s particularly with ios 6 than it does with the a6 when running graphically-intensive games there are clearly some improvements in frame rates as well as a noticeable lack of stutter on the iphone 5 general multitasking and app performance was superb in particular the new maps 3d flyover view pushed the phone hard and the differences between the older and newer models was clear basically there s not much to complain about when it comes to speed on the new phone it s really really fast a noticeable lack of stutter battery life one of the most amazing feats apple pulled off in the thinner lighter iphone 5 is that the battery life is not only as good as the previous phone.. it s actually better even when using lte data during my time testing the phone i did find that the battery life was improved over the 4s though lately my 4s levels have been dipping at an alarming rate the iphone 5 managed to stay with me through a typical day of heavy use web browsing loads of email and twitter some gaming music playback and occasionally watching videos though the meter was often near zero when i placed the phone back on the charger in the evening part of the battery drain can definitely be attributed to ios s confusing and poor handling of lock screen notifications which bizarrely wake the display up every single time a new notification comes in that s fine if you re a casual user but i get enough email and mentions on twitter that the alerts seemed to be affecting battery life when i turned off email and twitter notifications on the lock screen i did a little bit better still the long and short is that the iphone 5 s battery lives up to apple s claims you should have no fear about getting through a reasonable day even with lte data flowing in and out but for heavier users you re going to want to keep a wall charger handy data speeds the lte data on the iphone 5 is absolutely fantastic i tested the at amp t version of the phone and saw some of the strongest download and upload speeds yet on the network in midtown manhattan i managed to score between 5 and 10mbps downstream and weirdly much higher numbers up all the way up to 14mbps in brooklyn where i saw fewer bars the speeds generally hovered between 5 and 10mbps certainly better than anything i see on standard at amp t 3g excuse me i mean 4g in most situations the speed was enough to go without wi-fi if i wanted though of course that kind of throughput can result in nasty bills if you re not careful i m certain the meager 4gb of monthly data i pay for will be whisked away if i don t keep watch on what i m doing lte is just too easy to spend bits on i will say this the lte performance coupled with that improved battery life is possibly reason enough to buy this phone it s just very very good software software there s much to be said about the latest version of ios present in the new iphone and present in the old iphone and the ipad and we ve actually got a full review of the software itself still i have some personal thoughts on the older pieces of the stack as well as new additions apple has added to the mix the new ios is everything you would expect clean simple fast and easy to understand it is the very best that ios has ever been but it s crucial to point out that the gulf between ios 5 and ios 6 is extremely narrow for most users true to form apple is making nips and tucks tweaks stylistic edits not reinventing what the os does or how it does it there are some wonderful new flourishes in the operation system the kinds of things apple is known for such as reflections on your music controls that change when you tilt the phone or the mutating pull-to-refresh animation now present in the mail app the company has added some really great little touches like reply with text when you refuse a call present in other phone oses but nice to see here and do not disturb which lets you set a time window when only the most important people can get through to you ah silence overall though this is still the same ios you know and all the steps you took to get things done in the last os or in ios 4 or ios 3 even well those are pretty much the same too and some of those steps are maddening or poorly thought out in particular apple s implementation of unobtrusive notifications while you re using the phone stands out as one the weaker components of the system originally i saw notification center as a welcome relief from apple s pop-up messages and alerts but the way the company handles these beacons can now be nearly as annoying as the previous version as i mentioned instead of utilizing that new taller screen to give you notifications removed from areas of the phone you regularly need to access you know like menus in apps the notifications continue to pop down over the upper portion of the screen the result is that you feel trapped waiting for the message to disappear before you can access buttons you need to get to or forced to swipe to the left on the message a hidden function which scurries the dropdown away elsewhere apple is still making users jump through hoops to perform simple tasks like switching to a private browsing window or clearing the cache in safari it takes no less than six button presses and home key taps to make that happen while browsing settings in general are a mess wonderful when you first set up the phone hey everything is in one place but frustrating later when you have dozens of apps hey.. everything is in one place multitasking remains a black box not representing app states and forcing what should be always on applications like im clients into a constant state of shutdown warnings twitter won t update in the background nor will clients like tweetbot meaning that you re always playing catchup with realtime services mind you on android the twitter app will load updates in the background meaning that even if you re disconnected you ll likely have new content to view it sounds minor but when taken as a whole and spread across multiple applications it makes the os feel claustrophobic mysterious and downright unhelpful at times there are also missed opportunities apple has opened social sharing options up to twitter and facebook which is wonderful but everyone else is out in the cold want to save a file to a dropbox folder read an article later using pocket post a picture to tumblr right from the browser sorry that s not possible there may be some hacky bookmarklet to accomplish the task but i can t imagine anyone believes that a kludgy line of javascript is the most elegant way to accomplish those tasks and by the way these are things i do every day on my phone and things that i know lots of other people do they may be fringe to apple s target user but they are a real part of the market at large they are the part of the market pushing what smartphones are capable of and what they mean to users apple also leaves developers empty-handed on widgets it provides the minimally useful weather and stock widgets for the notification drawer but isn t opening up that space to anyone else and i must mention this the fact that the weather icon continues to read 73 degrees and sunny when it is clearly possible to have icons update with at least some information see the calendar icon is now laughable at best and sad at worst and what about actionable notifications notifications in jelly bean can be acted on without having to jump into an app which is a fantastic addition to android i use them all the time i would have loved to see apple innovate in this area especially considering the fact that ios multitasking still doesn t represent an always on experience don t get me wrong ios is a beautiful and well-structured mobile operating system but it s begun to show its age it feels less useful to me today than it did a couple of years ago especially in the face of increasingly sophisticated competition i always have this sense now in ios of not knowing where i am what my status is constantly having to load things and reload them it feels tiring maybe you ll call me an android fanboy for saying this or maybe it s because much of my business utilizes google apps and its communication tools but it didn t take me very long with the iphone 5 to start thinking about getting back to the galaxy nexus and jelly bean android 4.1 for what i do i think it s a more effective more elegant and more powerful os right now what it may lack in polish and consistency it makes up for in power and flexibility maps the new maps application in ios 6 is really handsome it s smooth fast and now provides free turn-by-turn navigation the new maps also shows off some of apple s new technology partnerships and acquisitions with its 3d flyover mode yelp integration and hooks into and out of siri but for me and for many people i know the new maps application is a big step backward for ios a downgrade as john gruber called it in his review of the iphone 5 and one that will take time perhaps years to become great again it s not impossible to see apple building its maps into something stellar but the company needs data that it simply doesn t have right now apple previously relied on google s mapping prowess to power this application on the phone that relationship has ended linked undoubtedly to the ever-growing animosity between the two companies and that has left ios users with a vastly inferior product in fact the product becomes even more inferior in the face of the latest android google maps app which continues to build on google s rich mapping data and content partnerships the new maps can be great at times mind you turn-by-turn worked very well for me and its interface is smartly and cleanly laid out i had a couple of issues where the gps seemed to lose signal or navigation stalled out altogether but that s happened on other phones so i don t know how much it s the fault of the iphone 5 or maps tomtom is powering the navigation and it seems like there are still kinks to be worked out traffic data for instance was scarce when compared side-by-side with google maps the flyover mode i mentioned is a nice effect but compared to what google now offers extensive street view indoor maps for some stores or museums it s hard to be too impressed by detailed renderings of buildings it s beautiful but not exactly useful but perhaps the biggest issue with the new maps is its complete lack of transit data this may not be an issue in other parts of the world but in new york having up-to-the-minute subway info can be seem like a matter of life or death on some days apple seems to be relying on developers to provide apps that will handle this data and there are some apps that do the job decently right now but it seems like a cheap and counterintuitive way out of this problem since when does apple choose to let developers pick up the slack of its first-party applications on the iphone email mail is largely unchanged save for a few new features firstly you re able to pull down to refresh which is a nice addition secondly mail now boasts a vip inbox where you can assign specific contacts sort of like google s priority inbox but much more manual it s also easier to flag messages in mail though it never seemed like too big of a hassle for me in the first place most of the changes are for the better if subtle one thing that hasn t changed however is mail s inability to search message content it didn t do it before and it doesn t do it now that can be a little trying when you re on the go and need information but don t know the best way to get at it it seems like a minor addition to index those messages so i m not sure why apple isn t doing it is it to hurt us a future update who can say siri i m happy to report that siri while still not out of beta seems far more capable on the iphone 5 and frankly on the updated 4s than ever before not only can the new siri now do things like tweet and post to facebook for you open applications give you sports scores and detailed information on movies but she generally just seems to be better and faster at finding all kinds of information a number of times while testing the iphone 5 i used siri to handle tasks that i didn t have my hands free for the service responded quickly and got the correct information i was looking for or carried out the requested task on the first try a noticeable improvement from the previous generation though i m certain that the lte connectivity when out and about is helping siri get connected much faster passbook passbook is kind of like an answer to a question no one asked at least i m not asking it maybe this is the kind of thing that will be really hot somewhere that i don t hang out very often like the south okay i just checked one member of the verge team is really excited about this idea regardless the new app which collects the qr codes and vital info from plane tickets starbucks cards movie tickets etc is certainly novel right now passbook feels as if it could be very useful.. or it could be the next ping an experiment gone horribly wrong only time will tell as many of the apps which utilize the functionality don t seem to be working yet for me fandango for instance apple reps assured me that many services are going live on launch day so everyone will have a better opportunity to roadtest the new tool ios 6 in closing there s a lot more to ios 6 than i could fit in this review at least reasonably fit and a lot of it most of it belongs not just to the iphone 5 but to older devices as well for the full breakdown of what the new software can do i highly recommend that you read our full ios 6 review wrap-up compare it apple iphone 5 gsm 8.8 verge score 8.7 user score write review good stuff incredible industrial design gorgeous display blazing fast lte service solid battery life bad stuff new maps app a step backwards bigger screen size not utilized at all ios 6 a retread of familiar territory apple has crafted a beast of a phone the iphone 5 is unquestionably the best iphone ever made and for the mass market it s the best smartphone period between the new design blazing fast lte and excellent battery life there s little to not like here it s a competent confident slick package certainly made better by most but not all of the updates and changes in ios 6 despite the maps issues and some questions about whether passbook will be a viable product there s no doubt that apple has crafted a beast of a phone a fine machine that is a worthy new entry in the most innovative line of products the company has ever made but there s also another segment of the market of which i consider myself a part that segment thinks that there s still a lot of work to be done in mobile devices still a lot of innovation to come and that s not innovation for the sake of innovation i mean real innovation in the way we use our phones in the flexibility of those operating systems in how those devices become an extension of ourselves for that segment i think the iphone 5 and ios 6 fall short there s a lot more work to be done but right now apple seems to be in a holding pattern too comfortable or too scared to take real chances i ll be eagerly awaiting the moment that apple joins the messy fray again i have no doubt it will happen but until then thank goodness for competition compare this iphone 5 vs galaxy s iii vs lumia 920

sample by the manufacturer that s been hand-picked just for us to test the hardware has been examined for defects every feature has been fully vetted and scrutinized and the software has been triple-checked for most every high-profile iphone 5 review you ve read so far this was the process in particular the dozen or so reviews that landed last week before ios 6 launched and before the phone was made available to everyone but we re bringing you the real deal i stayed up past midnight to pre-order my iphone 5 right when it went on sale i chose a black 32gb iphone 5 on at amp t i spent my own money my phone arrived via ups the same day the iphone went on sale at retail locations my review unit didn t go through any extra inspection processes it wasn t pampered or given any special treatment i ve tested exactly the same hardware you would get straight out of the box i ve tested exactly the same hardware you would get straight out of the box and let me tell you it s a gem for all the talk of the new iphone being boring iterative or lacking that trademark apple flavor of cutting-edge innovation it is undoubtedly the best handset you can buy the iphone 4s was also a fantastic phone and it still is but the subtle faults of the iphone 4s have now been rendered visible by their absence on the more refined iphone 5 if you re considering an upgrade i d recommend one especially if you skipped the last release if you re just now jumping into the iphone ecosystem this is a device that s sure to make a killer first impression the look of the thing especially the matte-black anodized aluminum rear plate is slick and sort of sinister it wouldn t look out of place in batman s tool belt the apple logo has been rendered in black too i miss the reflective silver apple logo of the iphone 4 and 4s which i used as a mirror but the new black logo better matches the black glass panels above and below the metal plate on the white version the apple logo is still silver one of my favorite design features of the iphone 5 is the chamfer at the edge of the front and rear faces on the iphone 4 and 4s the edges of the bezel were harder more like stair steps on the 5 the edge has more of a jewel-like diagonal slice this simultaneously gives the phone a smoother hand-feel and a more sophisticated less-clunky look also read our ios 6 review when i held the iphone 5 for the first time however the most dramatic change i noticed was the weight it s 20 percent lighter than the 4s 3.95 ounces 112 grams compared to 4.9 ounces 140 grams for the previous model after a few days of using it though i forgot about the extra heft my old phone had in fact when i pick up my old phone now it feels too heavy why is it so heavy apple shaved off one pane of glass in the display using in-cell technology to get the weight down and the new aluminum back that replaced the crack-prone glass eliminates some bulk unfortunately this attractive design feature may earn the distinction of becoming this iphone s achilles heel when it comes to damage particularly on the black model just a few days in there are already numerous reports from users complaining that the anodized aluminum back is getting scratched and scuffed the white model which uses a silver aluminum and keeps the silver apple logo is less susceptible to noticeable scratches sure enough after a few days of sliding my phone caseless in and out of the zippered pockets on my leather jacket i ve already developed a couple of small scratches pages 1 2 3 view all '),(473,'2012-10-09 00:00:00',9.6,99,' conclusion we like it when deciding how to overhaul the iphone 5 apple left no stone unturned the famously crack-prone back of the 4 and 4s has been replaced by a matte aluminum body that helps make it both thinner and lighter than any previous iphone and most of its competition it feels truly remarkable and the taller but not wider screen faster 4g lte wireless strong battery life upgraded processor and graphics and improved low-light photography make it a worthy upgrade even for many people who purchased a 4s last year if you re already an iphone or ipod user the iphone 5 heralds apple s latest big switch this time upgrading the aging ubiquitous 30-pin connector to a tiny versatile new lightning port adapters sold separately of course and its ios 6 operating system while largely an improvement over ios 5 now features turn-by-turn directions but significantly poorer maps and directions which apple has stated it intends to greatly improve over time the iphone 5 is exactingly thoughtfully designed from the inside out and apple s attention to detail shows it s by a wide margin the best iphone ever built and with a gdgt score of 96 is one of the best smartphones ever made

larger screen and faster 4g lte in a razor-sharp new design this is the iphone rebooted the new design is flat-out lovely both to look at and to hold and it s hard to find a single part that hasn t been tweaked from the iphone 4s the iphone 5 is at once completely rebuilt and completely familiar i ve had the chance to use the iphone 5 for nearly a week and have been using it for nearly anything i can think of is it as futuristic or as exciting as the iphone 4 or the original iphone no does this change the smartphone game no other smartphones beat it on features here and there if you want a larger screen go with a samsung galaxy s3 if you want better battery life go with a droid razr maxx but if you want a great all-around beautifully engineered smartphone that covers all bases here it is just like the macbook is to the world of laptops the new iphone is one of the top three if not the best-designed smartphone around it s better in all the important ways editors note we are continuing to update this review with additional observations and test results among the latest additions october 4 2012 are the inclusion of 4g lte speed tests see 4g lte faster at last section detailed comparisons to camera quality between the iphone and rival smartphones see the camera section and detailed battery test results for both video playback and talk time see battery section credit sarah tew what s different look at our review of last year s iphone 4s where we said even without 4g and a giant screen this phone s smartass voice assistant siri the benefits of ios 5 and its spectacular camera make it a top choice for anyone ready to upgrade credit cnet well guess what now it has 4g lte and...well maybe not a giant screen but a larger screen that s not all though the already great camera s been subtly improved speakerphone and noise-canceling quality has been tweaked and -- as always -- ios 6 brings a host of other improvements including baked-in turn-by-turn navigation a smarter siri and passbook a location-aware digital wallet app for storing documents like gift cards boarding passes and tickets the question is a full year later is that enough for me it is i don t want much more in my smartphone sure i d love a new magical technology to sink my teeth into but not at the expense of being useful right now i m not sure what that technology would even be credit cnet like every year in the iphone s life cycle a handful of important new features take the spotlight this time 4g screen size and redesign step to the top you ve gotten the full rundown already most likely on the various ins and outs of this phone or if you haven t i ll tell you about them below in greater detail here s what i noticed right away and what made the biggest impression on me credit cnet first off you re going to be shocked at how light this phone is it s the lightest iphone even though it s longer and has a bigger screen after a few days with it the iphone 4s will feel as dense as lead secondly the screen size lengthening is subtle but like the retina display you re going to have a hard time going back once you ve used it the extra space adds a lot to document viewing areas above the keyboard landscape-oriented video playback larger size and less letterboxing and home-page organizing an extra row of icons/folders who knows what game developers will dream up but odds are that extra space on the sides in landscape mode will be handily used by virtual buttons and controls credit sarah tew third this phone will make your home wi-fi look bad or at least it did that to mine owners of other 4g lte phones won t be shocked but iphone owners making the switch will start noticing that staying on lte versus wi-fi might actually produce faster results...of course at the expense of expensive data rates i hopped off my work wi-fi and used at amp t lte in midtown manhattan to make a facetime call to my wife because the former was slowing down lte in my tests ran anywhere from 10 to 20mbps which is up to twice as fast as my wireless router s connection at home using your iphone 5 as a personal hot spot for a laptop or other device produces some of the same strong results as the third-gen ipad...and it s smaller of course make sure you check on your tethering charges and data usage fees but my macbook air did a fine job running off the lte data connection at midday credit cnet the look thin metal light as heck you know its look even if the look has been subtly transformed over the years circular home button pocketable rectangle familiarly sized screen can that design be toyed with transformed a little changed from left the lumia 900 iphone 5 samsung galaxy s3 credit cnet the newest iphone has a wide metal body that stretches above previous iphones but is also thinner still this isn t a massive phone like the samsung galaxy note or htc one x the iphone 5 rises above the iphone 4 and 4s but subtly credit cnet from the front and sides it looks very similar to the iphone 4 and 4s the same rounded metal volume buttons sleep/wake button on top and silence switch remain the headphone jack has moved to the bottom of the phone just on like the ipod touch some will like it some won t it makes standing the iphone upright and using headphones a virtual impossibility actually the entire bottom is all new the headphone jack the larger redesigned speakers a different type of perforated grille and a much tinier lightning connector port credit cnet the gorilla glass back of the last iphone is gone replaced with metal the two-tone look might seem new but it s a bit of a reference to the silver-and-black back of the original iphone the very top and bottom of the rear is still glass that anodized aluminum -- which apple claims is the same as that on its macbook laptops -- feels exactly the same and is even shaded the same on the white model so far it s held up without scratches i d say it ll do about as well as the aluminum finish on your 2008-and-later macbook on the black iphone the aluminum matches in a slate gray tone on my white review model it s macbook-color silver that aluminum covers most of the back and also the sides replacing the iphone 4 and 4s steel band and lending to its lighter weight the front glass sits slightly above the aluminum which is cut to a mirrored angled edge on the front and back eliminating sharp corners credit cnet why the move away from a glass back is it about creating a better more durable finish or is it about weight reduction apple s proud of its claims of how light the iphone 5 is and the new aluminum back is part of that so is the move to a nano-sim card making sim swaps once again impossible and requiring a visit to your carrier s store so is the thinner screen and the smaller dock connector you get the picture hold an iphone 4s up to the new iphone and i could see the difference in thickness it s not huge but it feels even slimmer considering its expanded width and length what i really noticed is how light it is i still feel weirded out by it the iphone 5 s 3.95-ounce weight is the lightest an iphone s ever been the iphone 4s is nearly a full ounce heavier at 4.9 ounces the iphone 3g was 4.7 ounces the original iphone and iphone 4 were 4.8 ounces this is a phase-change in the nearly constant weight of the iphone -- it s iphone air yet the iphone 5 doesn t look dramatically different like the iphone 4 once did actually it seems more like a fusion of the iphone with the ipad and macbook design credit sarah tew and of course there s the new larger screen you may not notice it from a distance -- the screen s still not as edge-to-edge on the top and bottom as many android phones but extra empty space has been shaved away to accommodate the display there s a little less room around the home button and below the earpiece the iphone 5 screen is just as tall as the screen on the samsung galaxy s 2 but it s not as wide that thinner body design gives the iphone the same hand feel and what i think is an easier grip the extra length covers a bit more of your face on phone calls credit sarah tew over the last week with the iphone 5 i started to forget that the phone was any larger that seems to be the point and the iphone fit just fine in my pants too the extra length has been traded out for less girth so there s little bulge and with that awkward statement having been uttered i ll move on that 4-inch screen going longer the iphone 5 finally extends the 3.5-inch screen that s been the same size on the iphone for five years but it does so by going longer not wider a move from the iphone 4 and 4s 3.5-inch 960x640-pixel display to a 4-inch 1 136x640-pixel display effectively means the same retina display 326 pixels per inch but with extra pixel real estate versus a magnified screen all the icons and app buttons are the same size but there s more room for other features or more space for videos and photos to be displayed the iphone s interface is the same as always you have app icons greeting you in a grid and a dock of up to four apps at the bottom instead of a grid of four rows of four apps the longer screen accommodates five rows of four apps more apps can fit on the home screen but that s about it as far as user interface innovation extra screen height means pop-up notification banners are less intrusive at the top or bottom credit cnet it s odd at first going longer versus also adding width and it means a shift away from the ipad s more paperlike 4 3 display ratio pages of e-books could feel more stretched in portrait mode document text may not seem larger but you ll see more of it in a list credit cnet in landscape mode text actually seems bigger because page width stretches out so you can fit more words on a line the virtual keyboard in landscape mode also ends up a bit more spread out too with a little extra space on the sides which took some getting used to credit cnet i preferred portrait typing because the keyboard size and width remains the same while the extra length allows more visible text above the virtual keys the screen difference isn t always dramatic especially compared with some ultra-expansive android devices the samsung galaxy s3 beats it both on overall screen size 4.8 inches and pixel resolution 1 280x720 in the ios 6 mail app with one line of preview text i fit six and a half messages on the screen at the same time on the iphone 5 versus five and a third on the iphone 4 and 4s other apps toy with the layout more i fit eight tasks on one screen in the new ios 6 version of reminders versus five on the iphone 4s with ios 5.1.1 infinity blade ii before iphone 5 optimization note the black bars credit cnet of course you ll need new apps to take advantage of the longer screen and at the time i tested the iphone 5 those weren t available because ios 6 hadn t formally launched older apps run in a letterboxed type of mode at the same size as existing phones with little black bars on the top and bottom apps work perfectly fine this way especially in portrait mode but you definitely notice the difference app-makers will be scrambling to make their apps take advantage of the extra screen space and my guess is it won t take long at all for most to be iphone 5 and ipod touch ready credit cnet i tried imovie iphoto pages numbers keynote garageband icards and all of the iphone 5 s built-in apps maps reminders messages photos camera videos weather passbook notes stocks newsstand itunes the app store game center contacts calculator compass voice memos mail safari music and of course phone and they all take advantage of the extra space in a variety of useful ways how others will adopt the extra real estate remains to be seen credit cnet i m looking forward to killer apps that will take advantage of the larger screen so far i haven t found any that do it in surprising ways my guess is that games will benefit the most along with video and photo apps and to some degree reading/news apps credit cnet video playback of course has a lot more punch because the new 16 9 aspect ratio reduces or removes letterboxing across the board in landscape mode an hd episode of planet earth filled the entire screen while the available viewing space shrank down even more on the iphone 4s because of letterboxing youtube videos looked great some movies of course like pixar s wall-e still have letterboxing because they re shot in the superwide cinemascope aspect ratio 21 9 but they look a lot larger than before -- and you can still zoom in with a tap on the screen i think that much like the retina display you ll miss the iphone 5 s new screen more when you try to go back to an older phone the new display feels like a natural so much so that to the casual eye the iphone 5 doesn t look entirely different with the screen turned off the iphone 4 and 4s screens feel small and hemmed-in by comparison iphone 5 and iphone 4s video playback of the same 1080p nature video credit cnet the new iphone 5 s display also has a layer removed from the screen creating a display that acts as its own capacitive surface i didn t notice that difference using it it feels as crisp and fast-responding as before apple promises 44 percent extra color saturation on this new display much like the third-gen ipad s improved color saturation the difference wasn t as dramatic in a side-by-side playback of a 1080p episode of planet earth but the iphone 5 seemed to have a slight edge it was a little too close to call in game-playing photo-viewing and everyday experience with the phone even held side-by-side with the iphone 4s the real difference again is the size autobrightness adjustments have also been tweaked a little and i found on average that the iphone 5 found more-appropriate brightness levels for the room i was in credit cnet this seems like a good time to discuss thumbs as in your thumb size and the iphone 5 going back to the iphone 4s i realized that the phone s design has been perfectly aligned to allow a comfortable bridge between thumbing the home button and stretching all the way to the top icon on the iphone s 3.5-inch display that s not entirely the case now i could with some positioning still thumb the home button and make my way around the taller screen but the iphone 5 s a little more of a two-hander it might encourage more people and app developers to switch to landscape orientation where the extra length and pixel space provide finger room on both sides without cramming the middle credit cnet game developers are likely to lean toward the landscape 16 9 orientation because it more closely matches a standard hdtv s dimensions and most console games the extra width allows useful virtual button space too 4g lte faster at last last year s iphone 4s had a subtle network bump to 3.5g listed as 4g on the iphone 4s following ios 5.1 offering faster data speeds on at amp t the iphone 5 finally adopts faster lte joining most other smartphones on the market and even the third-gen ipad with the leap to lte back in march on the top corner of the iphone the service indicator reads lte when it s up and running however the presence of lte doesn t mean a world lte phone currently lte roaming between carriers overseas is impossible credit cnet there s also support depending on the iphone 5 version you buy for slower gsm including edge and umts/hspa and cdma/ev-do networks the iphone 5 s lte uses a single chip for voice and data a single radio chip and a dynamic antenna that will switch connections between different networks automatically in the united states at amp t sprint and verizon wireless will carry the iphone 5 t-mobile loses out in canada it s rogers bell telus fido virgin and koodo in asia the providers will be softbank smartone singtel and sk telecom for australia there s telstra optus and virgin mobile and in europe it will go to deutsche telekom and ee on carriers without lte the iphone 5 will run on dual-band 3.5g hdpa i didn t notice any problems when switching between lte and 4g but i tended to find myself stationary in a place that had lte service or a place that didn t without much time to test the transition midcall there s a catch though there are now two versions of iphone 5 in the u.s one gsm model and another version for the cdma carriers you may not have your dream of a universal lte phone but international roaming is possible between 2g and 3g also get ready to accept that verizon and sprint iphone 5s still won t be able to make calls and access data simultaneously even though many other verizon/sprint lte phones can pull this off that s because those other phones use a two-antenna system for lte/voice voice doesn t run over lte yet while the iphone 5 only uses one plus a dynamic antenna for what apple says is more connection stability nevertheless data access via 4g lte is stunningly fast this is no gentle upgrade in my home on the upper west side of manhattan i tested both my at amp t iphone 4s and the at amp t iphone 5 at the same time the iphone 4s averaged a 2.4mbps download speeds over 4g whereas the iphone 5 averaged 20.31mbps in comparison my home wireless internet via time warner averaged 9.02mbps at the hour i tested 1 30 a.m. for a more formal rundown cnet editors brian bennett

on verizon credit cnet the difference can be felt loading web pages the mobile version of cnet took 5.3 seconds over lte versus 8.5 seconds on the iphone 4s a graphically intensive web site like the desktop version of huffington post took 16 seconds to load via lte versus 23.3 seconds on the iphone 4s in 4g those who already use 4g lte may simply be nodding their heads but to iphone owners looking to upgrade this is major news for many people lte will be faster than their own home broadband of course that s a dangerous seduction with fast lte comes expensive rates and data caps at amp t also requires a specific plan to even enable facetime over cellular make sure you don t fall down the rabbit hole of overusing your lte because believe me you re going to want to i tried setting it up a wireless hot spot for my macbook air and the result was generally excellent outside major cities it s not quite as exciting if you don t have lte coverage using the at amp t iphone 5 out in east setauket long island data download speed was merely 3.5mbps because of a lack of at amp t lte service verizon s lte coverage map is larger but sprint s lte network is small as well my experience with at amp t and lte may not necessarily be yours wi-fi has also gotten a bit of a boost via dual-band 802.11n support over both 2.5ghz and 5ghz it should help in the event of interference with other wi-fi devices although i never encountered that problem before even with tons of wi-fi gadgets scattered about my apartment credit sarah tew the camera something on the iphone 5 has to not be new right well even the rear isight camera s been tweaked but not quite as much as other features it s still an 8-megapixel camera but there s a new sapphire-crystal lens and improved hardware enabling features like dynamic low-lighting adjustment image stabilization on the 1080p video camera and the capability to take still shots while shooting video credit cnet the camera takes excellent pictures a bit more so now than before the iphone 5 takes far clearer low-light pictures but the result while more coherent is grainier and lower resolution than the wonderfully detailed images taken in bright direct light i ran around in semi-darkness in my son s room taking pictures of his toys and found that the iphone 5 was able to make things out in places where the iphone 4s couldn t read josh goldman s detailed extensive testing of the iphone 5 s camera versus the samsung galaxy s3 and htc one x indoor shot with the iphone 5 credit cnet i settled for some indoor house shots instead to show off how the camera works in dimmer conditions of course you ll probably use flash in those instances but it can t hurt to have it as a backup iphone 5 camera outdoors credit cnet i took pictures outdoors and in and the biggest differences i could appreciate were the awesome new panorama mode and the even faster picture-taking one of these two features can be acquired on the iphone 4s via an ios 6 update

be more than one view all 28 photos in gallery physical featuresthe iphone 5 ditches the glass-sandwich design that apple has used for two years in exchange for a lighter slimmer quasi-unibody form at 4.9 by 2.3 by 0.3 inches hwd and 4 ounces it s notably lighter than the last iphone and one of the slimmest phones on the market rivaled by the t-mobile htc one s the front panel is still mostly screen a 4-inch 1 136-by-640 326 ppi display as opposed to the old 3.5-inch 960-by-640 326 ppi panel that makes the whole phone longer but no wider as a result it s very easy for people with small hands and short thumbs to touch every part of the screen without stretching .zd-video function c if window.jwplayer document.readyfunction k new array f .extendc jwplayerthis.id.setupf loading.. i found the new screen to be most important when playing games sure it allows more room for everything more facebook updates more web page text more calendar entries but it really shines for games where i ve felt previous iphones to be almost unbearably cramped and squinty you re going to be staring at your smartphone s screen a lot another 20 percent or so of information with no additional hand fatigue should be a no-brainer the headphone jack has moved down to the bottom of the phone which is a slight disappointment it means when you pull your phone out of your pocket by following the headphone cable it ll always be upside down also on the bottom panel are the fairly loud speaker and the controversial lightning connector the pitch of iphone owners whining about the new lightning port has become deafening mostly because of apple s blockheaded decision to charge 30 for its lightning-to-30-pin adapter while lightning continues apple s irritating policy of using non-standard connectors so it can profit from licensing the 30-pin dock connector was nearly a decade old it was time to go the sides and back of the new iphone are considerably more handsome than they used to be the matte black beveled edge of the black iphone we tested blends smoothly into the black anodized aluminum back relatively subtle glass panels at the top and bottom of the phone cover the invisible antennas there s also a snazzy white/silver version compared with this nearly unibody design the 4s looks clunky the new iphone looks more durable too without that big pane of glass on the back to crack other buttons and controls are where they usually are the iphone s raised separated volume controls have always been a nice feature as they re very easy to locate blindly rf reception and phone callsdispel all memories of the death grip rf reception here was excellent in my tests and the iphone 5 managed to nail two calls in a weak-signal area where the galaxy s iii couldn t connect with antennas behind glass panels at the top and bottom of the phone it s nearly impossible to cover both of them with your hand the iphone 5 isn t the world s best voice phone but it s good enough the earpiece is loud enough for most situations and the sidetone adapts to background noise so you don t end up yelling voice quality in quiet areas is well-defined the noise cancellation isn t nearly as good as the audience-powered noise canceling in the galaxy s iii some background noise leaks through which can create problems for automated response systems and the iphone 5 will clip your voice a bit when it s trying to dampen heavy noise but my voice was clear and audible over the background noise in test calls the speakerphone is of thoroughly average volume just as with the mouthpiece it does a decent but not perfect job of lowering background noise my jawbone era bluetooth headset worked just fine with siri once i figured out the rhythm you have to wait a few seconds after pressing the voice dialing button and then wait for the beep before issuing your command music video and game audio had no trouble making it over bluetooth in sync so this phone should work fine with your bluetooth headsets and speakers the verizon iphone 5 works on a wide range of networks according to apple it supports cdma ev-do rev a and rev b 800/1900/2100mhz umts/hspa /dc-hsdpa 850/900/1900/2100mhz gsm/edge 850/900/1800/1900mhz and lte bands 1/3/5/13/25 that s more networks than i ve ever seen on a single phone by default it will roam globally on the fastest 3g networks it can find verizon unlocks the sim card slots after 60 days if your account is in good standing so you can pop in a foreign sim card that is if you can find the so-far-obscure nano-sim format nobody else uses it yet but since apple s a behemoth i m sure it will catch on one thing you can t do is move a verizon iphone to sprint or at amp t s lte network it might work with t-mobile though sprint has and uses the ability to reject other carriers phones on its cdma network and this model lacks at amp t s lte bands 3g talk time was even better than apple promised at nine hours 44 minutes that s not quite as long as the galaxy s iii s 10 hours 43 minutes but it s still impressive back to top 1 2 3 '),(476,'2013-04-24 05:57:52',10.0,99,'I love this phone.
